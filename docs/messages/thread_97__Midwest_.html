Hi guys!<br>
Speaking just for myself, I'm from Oklahoma and have never really <br>
considered myself being "midwestern".  I've always considered Oklahoma <br>
being in the south.  After all, we do have the southern accent, hahaha.<br>

state has participants on this board.  I have seen some reference <br>
materials take the Midwest to Colorado and other areas...so I don't <br>
know.  I'm right on the boarder of Kansas and Missouri and consider <br>
them both Midwest.<br>

Oh and Mel, you may have the accent, but remember you also have <br>
those shoes that are to die for!  I'm still hoping to make it to <br>
Tulsa weekend after nextwe'll seel<br>

Midwest as kind of a line from Chicago to St. Louis, across to KC and <br>
then down to Dallas and Houston.  Then west side is up the eastern <br>
foothills of the Rockies.  I would break that area down into three <br>
sub-areas:  Great Lakes, Northern Plains and Southern Plains.<br>
<br>
I lived in Cincinnati for seven years and they always called it the <br>
Midwest, but that's an east coast construct, people in Cincinnati are <br>
way more east coast (read not as friendly) than here in KC.<br>

Just my 2 cents.<br>

Midwest.  My  husband grew up in Boston and anything west of 
Lexington, MA was Midwest to them.  But to me, Kentucky is a Southern State 
and Oklahoma is definitely not a Midwest state - maybe they couldn't think
