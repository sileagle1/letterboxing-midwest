                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from vacation to Arkansas via southeast Oklahoma and <br>
it was great!  Thanks to letterboxes placed in Beavers Bend Resort <br>
Park in OK, my family stayed there and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  <br>
Another example of letterboxing introducing me to a place I never <br>
heard of before.  Another pleasant surprise was Mt. Magazine in AR.<br>
There is a new State Park up there now and a beautiful Lodge that <br>
just opened in May.  We had a third floor room with a balcony <br>
overlooking the valley below and it was incredible.  Lots for the <br>
kids to do, too.<br>
<br>
Other places that were equally enjoyable were the Talimena Scenic <br>
Byway, Mt. Nebo, Altus wineries, Petit Jean SP and De Gray SP.  <br>
Though I only found the boxes in OK (none were found in AR where we <br>
went), I placed 2 in OK and 3 in AR for future travelers.  Since LBNA <br>
is down, I will include the links to these 5 new boxes here in case <br>
anyone wants to get started right away.  I highly recommend going to <br>
these places.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Kim, good to hear from you again.  I found both of your boxes:<br>
Italian Festival & Family Fun.  I found Hit The Road Jack HH in <br>
Family Fun and brought it back to TX.  You must have taken it during <br>
our Event last March.  I was the only one to stamp into that box and <br>
it was a long hike since I unknowingly chose the long way to it.  <br>
Nice hike and box.<br>
<br>
I also found Playin Poohsticks, Red Ranger, and 3 of the 4 Broken <br>
Bow Reservoir letterboxes.  The lake was down and I could not <br>
determine which tree was supposed to be in the water.  Thanks for <br>
bringing me to this place and providing boxes.<br>
<br>
