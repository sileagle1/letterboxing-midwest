                    <div class="plaintext-content">The refuge has a great camp site, Camp Doris. It is for tents or RV <br/>
camping. They have from Primative site to elecric site. You can get <br/>
an electrical site even if you are in a tent if they have any open. <br/>
Camp Doris also has one set of bath houses on the grounds with <br/>
running water. It has toilets, sinks and showers. The showers are <br/>
preset tempatures and sometimes the hot water runs out quick. Many <br/>
nights I have ended up with cold showers. They have a check in <br/>
station when you enter the site and you can buy ice and some sodas at <br/>
the station. No store on the refuge though. Camp Doris is set along <br/>
side of the Lake and is named after a miners camp that was there in <br/>
the early 1900's. From the camp ground you can hike to the education <br/>
center and on alot of nature trails. My family and I live in Lawton <br/>
which is only about 20 minutes from the refuge. We love camping out <br/>
at Doris. We are at the refuge almost every weekend hiking.<br/>
