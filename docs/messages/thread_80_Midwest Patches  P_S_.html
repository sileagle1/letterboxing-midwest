Since not all the patches I show up on Mark Pepe's blog, I posted <br>
photos of some additional patches in the Photo section of this message <br>

Although I haven't done much boxing in the "Midwest Region" yet, I <br>
hope to hide another box in Iowa at the end of June.  We're also <br>
thinking of attending the St. Louis event in September....<br>

Wisconsin Hiker, it would be FABULOUS to have you guys attend the St. <br>
Louis gather!  Seems to me it would make our city's first event <br>
really "official" to have such well-traveled boxer's as you attend!<br>
<br>
Although work is still a little crazy, things should settle down <br>
soon, and once I return from a week's boxing in the mid-Atlantic <br>
(geckospot and I are going to the "Alienteering" gather in French <br>
Creek) my "epic" series should get planted.  <br>
<br>
FWIW, my most recent plants have been on nice long hikes - hope <br>
you'll have the time to hit a couple of those when you finally get to <br>
St. Louie...<br>
<br>
Hope you and Martini Man are well and happy - and hope to see you <br>
again soon!<br>

Yes, we certainly would carve something for the event.  Once we get our <br>
vacation plans firmed up, I'll let you know.  We often plant event <br>
boxes ourselves after we arrive.  This gives the event organizers a box <br>
or two to look for themselves, instead of just doing all the planting.  <br>
However it sounds like you have a specific plan in mind, so we'd be <br>
happy to send in advance if that is what you prefer.<br>
