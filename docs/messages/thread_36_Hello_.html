                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was suggested (I think maybe by Silver Eagle) that I join the <br/>
group and share what we've been doing in Mid-Missouri.  I think we <br/>
have a fantastic little LB community.  C2B2 started a blog and much <br/>
of our recent activity can be viewed there.  If you're curious take a <br/>
peek.  www.midmoletterboxing.blogspot.com .  <br/>
<br/>
I hosted our second annual Mid-MO Spring LB gathering several months <br/>
ago.  If you'd like to see some pictures, a good article and a <br/>
picture of the invitation, look in the archives (on the right as you <br/>
scroll down).  I believe most of the gathering info is in May and a <br/>
bit in April.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like more information about past Mid-MO Gatherings (this <br/>
last Spring makes our 4th), or if you want information about future <br/>
Gatherings, just drop me a line.  Plans are under way for a Fall <br/>
Gathering (though these are traditionaly not the big affairs the <br/>
Spring Gatherings tend to be) and work has already begun on the <br/>
Spring 2007 Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to this board and being in tune with whats happeing in <br/>
the region.  Thanks to whomever suggested I join.<br/>
