My family of 3 sons and one dh box on the Kansas side of the Kansas <br/>
City area, but we love finding and placing boxes wherever we go. We <br/>
just returned from vacation through Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin and <br/>
just over the boarder of Michigan. We placed a new box in each state <br/>
(clues to come later) and had a great time finding 10 boxes plus 1 HH. <br/>
<br/>
Our favorite find came when we took our minivan up what ended up being <br/>
four wheeler trails to a fire tower in Wisconsin. We chugged up some <br/>
mighty sandy roads, but after finally reaching the top we found the <br/>
box and real wild blueberries covering the hillside to boot! The kids <br/>
have not stopped talking about wanting to go back to that letterbox.<br/>
