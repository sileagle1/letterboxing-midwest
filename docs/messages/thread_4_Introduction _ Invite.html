a member, even though I don't live in any of the<br/>
states.  I am from TX and have been letterboxing for<br/>
over 3 years, but I like to belong to regional groups<br/>
near TX and ones with states that I have boxes in, and<br/>
both apply to this group.  Hopefully this Group will<br/>
help letterboxing grow in the Heartland like it has in TX.  <br/>
We started the TX Talklist about 2 years ago when there <br/>
were less than 10 people that I knew of participating in <br/>
the whole state.  Soon, more and more people started joining <br/>
the group, discussing ideas and encouraging each other in <br/>
ways impossible to do on the Big List.  Now we have over <br/>
150 members and are about to have our third Event.  Which <br/>
leads me to my invite, especially to those of you in Oklahoma <br/>
or Arkansas since you are closer.  The TX Boxcar LB Event <br/>
will be held on March 18, 2006 at Rusk State Park in Northeast <br/>
TX.  Please visit the website for more details:<br/>

I probably won't be very active in the List, but will enjoy <br/>
watching it grow over the coming months.  Have fun and don't <br/>
be afraid to speak up.<br/>

I think there's also a gathering planned for the Midwest next year -- <br/>
maybe the planner will jump in with more details!<br/>
