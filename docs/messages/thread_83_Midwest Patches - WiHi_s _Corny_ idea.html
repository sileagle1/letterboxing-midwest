&gt; I'm not sure I would be able to design one either, but if there are <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From what I understand that is how some groups have done it before; <br/>
&gt; there are some that actually submit ideas and then others might <br/>

second, <br/>
&gt; third, etc. design option and then folks vote.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a folder here if anyone would like to submit a design <br/>

&gt; isn't empty, but it is not an actual design submission, just a WIP.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It would be most interesting to know who might be interested in <br/>
what <br/>
&gt; kind of patch. More states, fewer states, individual states?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Y'all from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska, Iowa, as well as Kansas <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; Missouri...do you have any ideas?  What about the Dakotas?  Are any <br/>
&gt; of you around?<br/>

&gt; Also, the company that Lock Wench works with for her patches will <br/>

&gt; &gt;   That's kind of what I was thinking. I'd like it to be similar <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   the Great Lakes that incorporates several states, but if people <br/>
&gt; &gt;   would rather have their own state that would be fine, too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I just posted a similar question on AQ to see if anyone there <br/>
&gt; has <br/>
&gt; &gt;   knowledge/preference of any existing or contributing to the <br/>
&gt; design <br/>
&gt; &gt;   process.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Would you be interested in a patch? Would you prefer a Kansas <br/>
&gt; Patch <br/>
&gt; &gt;   or a patch with multiple states in the midwest?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Would you be interested in contributing a design for vote?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I'm not only asking Us4InKS, but everyone who might read this <br/>
&gt; &gt;   board. You certainly would not have to live in the midwest to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   submit a design or to have a patch.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Please share your thoughts.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; Maybe a contest can be started for the mid-west like the <br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; Does anyone know of any patches for Midwest letterboxing? <br/>
What <br/>
&gt; &gt;   about <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; any midwestern states?<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; Thought it might be nice to see if I can get a handful for <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Kansas <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; City Gathering in September.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; There seems to be more interest than I expected and am hoping <br/>
&gt; &gt;   that <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; some from nearby states (Iowa, Nabraska, Oklahoma, Arkansas, <br/>
&gt; &gt;   etc) <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; think about a weekend Trek or Day Trip.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [LetterboxingMidwest] Midwest Patches<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know of any patches for Midwest letterboxing? <br/>
&gt; What <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any midwestern states?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thought it might be nice to see if I can get a handful for <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kansas <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; City Gathering in September.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There seems to be more interest than I expected and am hoping <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some from nearby states (Iowa, Nabraska, Oklahoma, Arkansas, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think about a weekend Trek or Day Trip.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>
