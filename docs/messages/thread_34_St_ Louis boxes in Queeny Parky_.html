Anyone know?  I know they've got more to worry about there than<br>

I'm going to forward your email to the placer, Fairy Princess Fiona -<br>
she lives quite close to the park and can probably run over and make<br>
sure they're ok.<br>
<br>
Be sure to see if I've gotten the Tower Grove Park series planted by<br>
the time you visit - I'm just waiting for the park to get cleaned up a<br>
little before I plant!<br>
