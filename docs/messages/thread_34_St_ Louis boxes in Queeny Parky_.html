I'm going to forward your email to the placer, Fairy Princess Fiona -<br/>
she lives quite close to the park and can probably run over and make<br/>
sure they're ok.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to see if I've gotten the Tower Grove Park series planted by<br/>
the time you visit - I'm just waiting for the park to get cleaned up a<br/>
little before I plant!<br/>
