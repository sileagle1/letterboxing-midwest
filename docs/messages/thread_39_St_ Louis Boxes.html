Park this week.  Her stamps were wonderful and that park is a<br/>
wonderful place.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, son 11 and daughter 7 spent part of a morning and an<br/>
afternoon hunting.  The kids gave out at the end and my husband stayed<br/>
with them but we managed to find all 7 plus the 8th with help from the<br/>
placer.<br/>
<br/>
We also found one by Princess Lea in Wood River, IL.  One alluded us<br/>
but the other was great and I highly recommend this Lewis &amp; Clark site<br/>
to anyone remotely interested in their exploration.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home we found a box on Interstate 44 at highway marker 52.<br/>
 I can't remember all the details and the web site is down so I can't<br/>
tell you the placer, even though we've found his before.  Sorry!  But<br/>
it was fun and an easy one for my kids to enjoy.  Missouri rest areas<br/>
are amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Not bad for a trip when most of the week there was over 100 degrees<br/>
and you sweated just laying still.<br/>
