Alas, things are still quite hectic the week after we close.  It really<br>
doesn't settle down for about a month, and now, with all the new<br>
education programs we've got going on, it's busy even then.  We really<br>
need to petition our board of directors to add staff.  But it's all<br>
good - I love my job and my organization, and since I get 3 - count 'em<br>
3 - weeks of vacation each year (plus we close the office the week<br>
between xmas and new year's) I can't really complain about not getting<br>
time off in May or June. (Obviously, we also don't get Memorial Day as<br>
a holiday.)  I will def. be planning to hit another gather sometime<br>
next year; just waiting at this point to see what's going on where.<br>
<br>
If you're interested, you should come down during the run - we are<br>
working hard to become one of the premier Shakespeare companies in the<br>
country.  At this time, we're kind of locked into a single-play, 3-1/2<br>
week run (due to other committments in the park) but we're looking into<br>
expansion opportunities for '08.  This year's show will be "Much Ado<br>
About Nothing".  Oh! And since I've shared my "new addiction" with my<br>
co-workers, I've been charged with creating "Much Ado" themed<br>
letterboxes for part of the kid's activities during our pre-play Green<br>
Show!  Not quite sure what those are gonna be yet...any thoughts?<br>
