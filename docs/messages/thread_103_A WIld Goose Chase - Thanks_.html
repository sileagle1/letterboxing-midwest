                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to say that we really enjoyed attending our <br>
first "Midwest Region" event.  Big Purple Foot & ScoutAngel (and <br>
probably other assistants) did a nice job of organizing the event.  <br>
The food was delicious - lots of tasty salads and someone even <br>
brought baked beans just like my mom makes - YUM!<br>
<br>
We spent the first several hours eating and exchanging, since there <br>
were many boxers attending that we hadn't seen at previous events.  <br>
Of course we also enjoyed catching up with old friends from the Great <br>
Lakes region!<br>
<br>
Eventually it was time to hit the trails to find some boxes, which <br>
were nicely scattered throughput the park.  Who would have thought it <br>
would be quite SO HOT in October?!?!  It was 88 on Saturday and 89 <br>
today, so we got a workout in the heat.  However we found lots of <br>
nice boxes as a reward, and were thankful that there weren't many <br>
bugs at all.<br>
<br>
I've posted a group photo from the event in the Photos section of <br>
this message board.<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to returning to the Quad Cities area again <br>
since there are many more boxes to find and it is a fairly easy drive <br>
from the Milwaukee, WI area.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who contributed to a nice event!<br>

Showeee, no kidding on who turned on the hot-o-meter.  I was in <br>
Houston a few days before the Yellow Brick Trail event on Saturday.  <br>
Sure, it was hot, like Texas hot and Teepsman and I were getting <br>
wilty, but the day before the event, it started raining and brought <br>
the heat.<br>
<br>
Everyone was breaking a sweat just stamping in.  Nevermind just <br>
breaking a sweat just standing still too.<br>
