to be out.  There is a HH hostel on I-70 in Lawrence (Joyrider HH <br/>

dropped one off but some great HH's are languishing, so if you're <br/>
driving down I-70, it's right off an exit, a pretty easy find.<br/>

We went out twice, looking for four boxes and found three.  First, we<br/>
hit Babler Park in Chesterfield to find the "Snake Doctor" box planted<br/>
there this past May.  Although we were pretty sure we were in the<br/>
correct spot, we did not find the box, so I used the "contact the<br/>
placer" link to inquire.  Then we drive south a few miles to the Rock<br/>
Wood Reservation - this was a very cool place, as the last remaining<br/>
lime kiln in the St. Louis area is there.  A short walk and a bit of<br/>
poking around in the rocky ledge area earned us the "Rock Woods" box -<br/>
planted back in 2000!  It was still in fine shape, so if you never got<br/>
this one, it's still waiting for you!<br/>
<br/>
Next day, we went back to Queeny Park to get the last two boxes in the<br/>
"Queens" series.  If you are in the St. Louis area, i HIGHLY recommend<br/>
you look for these - they are BEAUTIFUL hand-carved stamps, created by<br/>
the Fairy Princess Fiona.  Clues for seven of them are on-line; once<br/>
you find them and work the little puzzle, FPF will send you the link<br/>
for the final box.  <br/>
<br/>
Sadly, the first time we went we found one box destroyed, the log and<br/>
stamp missing.  She replaced that one in a new and hopefully more<br/>
secure spot.  She told me that a second one turned up missing, and<br/>
she's now ready to re-plant it - we're going to meet up tomorrow, so I<br/>
can still be the first person to stamp in on the log.  I'm so happy<br/>
that my new hobby of letterboxing has now led me to make a new friend<br/>
in the area!<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a happy and safe 4th!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; that my new hobby of letterboxing has now led me to make a new<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the area!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope everyone had a happy and safe 4th!<br/>

their fountains of KC series.<br/>
<br/>
If you're in the KC area either now, but especially in December and<br/>
thereafter, be sure and check out the expanded museum complex at<br/>
Liberty memorial. For out-of-towners, the memorial is the only museum<br/>
to WWI veterans in the nation. We talked to one of the volunteers<br/>
there and she said the new museum will include lots of interactivity<br/>
for kids plus rotating exhibits in the current museum space. (Plus,<br/>
don't forget those great boxes you can pick up!)<br/>

&gt; We were out and about over the holiday, a couple of plants in Kansas <br/>
&gt; City and some finds in Kansas.  Yesterday (the 5th) was a beautiful day <br/>
&gt; to be out.  There is a HH hostel on I-70 in Lawrence (Joyrider HH <br/>
&gt; hostel) that hadn't had any action for about a year, we took one and <br/>
&gt; dropped one off but some great HH's are languishing, so if you're <br/>
&gt; driving down I-70, it's right off an exit, a pretty easy find.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We found boxes in Oklahoma and Missouri.  Tried to find one in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Arkansas.  We even helped place one in Missouri.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hot weekend, but fun.<br/>

&gt; I'll be visiting my folks in St. Louis on July 18-21.  I'm not sure<br/>
&gt; which boxes I'll get to do, but definitely Sprite &amp; Highlander's<br/>
&gt; Jukebox Lessons as my parents live fairly close--within a couple<br/>
&gt; miles<br/>
&gt; of Forest Park.  If the weather's good, we might be able to get a few<br/>
&gt; of the Queeny Park boxes in, but that's a question mark.  Parents<br/>
&gt; aren't much into letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll try to leave a little treat behind for St. Louis boxers--the<br/>
&gt; area<br/>
&gt; could certainly stand some seeding.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You're very welcome!  Assuming I get my act together by then, I<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; have planted boxes in Tower Grove Park before you arrive, and maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; (MAYBE) in Mastadon State Park.  So keep an eye out on LBNA and AQ<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; those.  Also, feel free to email me if you want to meet up in<br/>
&gt; August<br/>
&gt; &gt; for an exchange.  :-)  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We went out twice, looking for four boxes and found three. <br/>
&gt; First,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hit Babler Park in Chesterfield to find the "Snake Doctor" box<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there this past May.  Although we were pretty sure we were in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct spot, we did not find the box, so I used the "contact<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placer" link to inquire.  Then we drive south a few miles to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rock<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wood Reservation - this was a very cool place, as the last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; remaining<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lime kiln in the St. Louis area is there.  A short walk and a<br/>
&gt; bit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poking around in the rocky ledge area earned us the "Rock<br/>
&gt; Woods"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planted back in 2000!  It was still in fine shape, so if you<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this one, it's still waiting for you!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day, we went back to Queeny Park to get the last two boxes<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Queens" series.  If you are in the St. Louis area, i HIGHLY<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you look for these - they are BEAUTIFUL hand-carved stamps,<br/>
&gt; created<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Fairy Princess Fiona.  Clues for seven of them are on-line;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; once<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you find them and work the little puzzle, FPF will send you the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; link<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the final box.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadly, the first time we went we found one box destroyed, the<br/>
&gt; log<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stamp missing.  She replaced that one in a new and hopefully<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; secure spot.  She told me that a second one turned up missing,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she's now ready to re-plant it - we're going to meet up<br/>
&gt; tomorrow,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can still be the first person to stamp in on the log.  I'm so<br/>
&gt; happy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that my new hobby of letterboxing has now led me to make a new<br/>
