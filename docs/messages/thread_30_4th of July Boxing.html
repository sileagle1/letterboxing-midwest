to be out.  There is a HH hostel on I-70 in Lawrence (Joyrider HH <br>

dropped one off but some great HH's are languishing, so if you're <br>
driving down I-70, it's right off an exit, a pretty easy find.<br>

We went out twice, looking for four boxes and found three.  First, we<br>
hit Babler Park in Chesterfield to find the "Snake Doctor" box planted<br>
there this past May.  Although we were pretty sure we were in the<br>
correct spot, we did not find the box, so I used the "contact the<br>
placer" link to inquire.  Then we drive south a few miles to the Rock<br>
Wood Reservation - this was a very cool place, as the last remaining<br>
lime kiln in the St. Louis area is there.  A short walk and a bit of<br>
poking around in the rocky ledge area earned us the "Rock Woods" box -<br>
planted back in 2000!  It was still in fine shape, so if you never got<br>
this one, it's still waiting for you!<br>
<br>
Next day, we went back to Queeny Park to get the last two boxes in the<br>
"Queens" series.  If you are in the St. Louis area, i HIGHLY recommend<br>
you look for these - they are BEAUTIFUL hand-carved stamps, created by<br>
the Fairy Princess Fiona.  Clues for seven of them are on-line; once<br>
you find them and work the little puzzle, FPF will send you the link<br>
for the final box.  <br>
<br>
Sadly, the first time we went we found one box destroyed, the log and<br>
stamp missing.  She replaced that one in a new and hopefully more<br>
secure spot.  She told me that a second one turned up missing, and<br>
she's now ready to re-plant it - we're going to meet up tomorrow, so I<br>
can still be the first person to stamp in on the log.  I'm so happy<br>
that my new hobby of letterboxing has now led me to make a new friend<br>
in the area!<br>
<br>
Hope everyone had a happy and safe 4th!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a big day of boxing here in hot KC today. We visited Craw &<br>
Joey's new boxes at Liberty Memorial and also got three boxes from<br>
their fountains of KC series.<br>
<br>
If you're in the KC area either now, but especially in December and<br>
thereafter, be sure and check out the expanded museum complex at<br>
Liberty memorial. For out-of-towners, the memorial is the only museum<br>
to WWI veterans in the nation. We talked to one of the volunteers<br>
there and she said the new museum will include lots of interactivity<br>
for kids plus rotating exhibits in the current museum space. (Plus,<br>
don't forget those great boxes you can pick up!)<br>

I've told about it don't seem interested, except for one, who's too<br>
