<br>
Yep - things were/are a mess here.  The storm was maybe a twister (get<br>
into the root cellar, Dorothy!) and there's plenty of property damage.<br>
<br>
My visitng friend Dorothy and I were going to plant 8 boxes in Tower<br>
Grove Park, but did not, for obvious reasons.  The boxes are done, and<br>
once the park is cleaned up a bit, hopefully in a week or so, I will<br>
plant them and post clues.<br>
<br>
We were very lucky - no damage to our persons or property, and as of<br>
today, we have our power back!  Now to finish wading through the 200<br>
emails...  ;-)<br>
