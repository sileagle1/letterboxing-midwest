<br/>
Yep - things were/are a mess here.  The storm was maybe a twister (get<br/>
into the root cellar, Dorothy!) and there's plenty of property damage.<br/>
<br/>
My visitng friend Dorothy and I were going to plant 8 boxes in Tower<br/>
Grove Park, but did not, for obvious reasons.  The boxes are done, and<br/>
once the park is cleaned up a bit, hopefully in a week or so, I will<br/>
plant them and post clues.<br/>
<br/>
We were very lucky - no damage to our persons or property, and as of<br/>
today, we have our power back!  Now to finish wading through the 200<br/>
emails...  ;-)<br/>

&gt; Well, that was a bust.  If anyone's seen the news, let me tell you-<br/>
&gt; StLouis looks terrible in person, at least my parents' neighborhood. <br/>
&gt; Instead of finding and hiding boxes, we spent much of our day<br/>
&gt; yesterday cleaning up after a horrific windstorm snapped trees left<br/>
&gt; and right like matchsticks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My parents, thankfully, have power, unlike much of the city.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I didn't get my boxes hidden.  I'll do it next time, unless<br/>
&gt; someone going that way would like me to send them the boxes to plant,<br/>
&gt; I'll happily do so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope the others from the area are doing well,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Greetings from the Lou!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you are here through Thursday of this week, my visiting friend<br/>
&gt; &gt; Peregrin8 and I are planting eight, count 'em, EIGHT boxes in Tower<br/>
&gt; &gt; Grove Park.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, we might not get all eight planted this week.  But we're gonna<br/>
&gt; try.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Clues posted as soon as is humanly possible!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My bags are not (yet) packed, but I'll be in St. Louis for a few<br/>
&gt; days<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am hoping to plant 2-3.  I have two:  Meet Me in St. Louis &amp; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Clydesdale completely ready to go (I like to carve; hate<br/>
&gt; assembling <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes).  If I have time, I might carve a micro as well.  I would <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; really like to place a UCity Lion box, as that is my home town.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure how much time there'll be for finding.  My kids get <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; awfully whiny if the temperature is much above 90 and I know how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; humid <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; StL in the summer can be!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And, my main purpose for going is to see the Chihuly exhibit at<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Botanical Gardens and to see some chums I haven't seen in a<br/>
&gt; while.<br/>
