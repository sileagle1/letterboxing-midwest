<br>
Ok, this is funny - I got on line today to get the clues for Babler;<br>
we're heading out as soon as the man gets home. (Which is shortly -<br>
better get off the 'puter and get ready!)  I saw where you got my<br>
Turkish Pavilion box and were a newbie on AQ.  And here you are now!  I<br>
wonder if we'll run into one another on the trail.<br>
<br>
We didn't find "Snake Doctor" last time we went, but did find the older<br>
box over by the lime kiln.  Good luck!  I'm sure we'll be in touch. <br>
