<br/>
Ok, this is funny - I got on line today to get the clues for Babler;<br/>
we're heading out as soon as the man gets home. (Which is shortly -<br/>
better get off the 'puter and get ready!)  I saw where you got my<br/>
Turkish Pavilion box and were a newbie on AQ.  And here you are now!  I<br/>
wonder if we'll run into one another on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't find "Snake Doctor" last time we went, but did find the older<br/>
box over by the lime kiln.  Good luck!  I'm sure we'll be in touch. <br/>

&gt; Howdy from a 1 week old newbie from St. Louis!  My kids and I (7 &amp; 4)<br/>
&gt; carved our stamps last Saturday and went to Tower Grove Park.  I<br/>
&gt; thought we could find several boxes the first time, and my kids would<br/>
&gt; love it.  But we found the Turkish Pavilion one first, and then the<br/>
&gt; kids saw the playground, and it was all over.  :0)   We spent the day<br/>
&gt; playing and when we were finished, were really too beat to look for<br/>
&gt; anything else.  However, we did drive around a little so that we'd<br/>
&gt; know where to go next time.  There were about 4 wedding parties doing<br/>
&gt; pictures so I guess no way to be discrete on a beautiful Saturday. <br/>
&gt; But then again, is there any way to be discrete with a 4 year old?!<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   We plan to head to Wildwood today; I have the clues for 1 in Babler<br/>
&gt; and another off 109.  Hopefully I can keep the kids interested...<br/>
