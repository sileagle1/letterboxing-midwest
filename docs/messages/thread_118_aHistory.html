the Ok group.<br>
 Boy, it sure is quiet in here, kind of gives me the creeps! Where <br>
are all the midwesterners? Did they all disappear? I hear the <br>
twilight zone music playing in the background. You Whooo! tap, tap, <br>
tap, knocking on the screen now.<br>
 Why don't you all pack your bags and come on down/up/across/around <br>
to Oklahoma, aHistory is coming to town!!! When? July 18-21st. Hope <br>
we get things worked out and can let you know the exact date of our <br>
gathering. He is talking about night boxing!!! Won't that be a hoot!<br>
 We are working to find some place as I write, well, not at this very <br>
moment, but you know. Tulsa town is the place to be, or there 'bouts. <br>
See afore mentioned sentence. We would sure like to see some new <br>
faces 'round here, and ?old? ones too? lol.<br>
 This land is your land, this land is my land, and it needs boxes <br>
planted bad, I mean bad, lots of open spaces and hidey holes need <br>
filling. Heck, its just sittin' here waitin' on ya, what? you aren't <br>
here yet? We have the most lakes in the country, I think, so lots of <br>
water to play in. Can't see any reason you all shouldn't come enjoy <br>
it, either. Vacation time is here, my friends, take a plane, ride a <br>
bus, drive your economy car, just get here, in time for the gather. <br>
Ya'll come! Soup's on. We'll be listening for the car doors slammin'. <br>
