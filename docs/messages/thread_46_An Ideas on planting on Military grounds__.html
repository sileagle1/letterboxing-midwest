Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'll preface this by saying that I'm not a huge one for asking <br/>
permission to plant on public land.  If the letterbox is hidden well, <br/>
unobtrusive and well taken care of, I'm not too worried about whether <br/>
there is a "rule" against planting in that area.  I haven't planted <br/>
(and probably wouldn't) in a national park because that seems to be <br/>
taboo.  That being said, if there is a place I would ask permission <br/>
for, it would probably be military land, especially the way things <br/>
stand today.  Anyone seen "hiding" anything on a military base might <br/>
end up in Guantanamo or a "secret" CIA prison ;).  Let's make sure <br/>
that letterboxers are not labeled as enemy combatants, we do have <br/>
weapons of mass destruction (OK linoleum cutters and exacto knives), <br/>
and our carving materials could be miscontrued as plastic explosive.  <br/>
You wouldn't want to see a letterbox destroyed by remote device.<br/>
<br/>
All kidding aside, I think in this situation, I would definitely ask <br/>
permission (maybe go to the public relations officer/dept. first) <br/>
before planting a letterbox on a military base.  I wouldn't hold my <br/>
breath about it, but you never know.<br/>

How easy is it to get on base for non-military?  <br/>
<br/>
Are you talking about tourism areas, like Geronimo areas?  They might<br/>
be interesting in giving permission in those areas.  But it definitely<br/>
could cause trouble if we were trying to be stealthy.  Be sure and<br/>
have the box finished and then bring it to show to them.<br/>

All you have to have to get onto post is an ID. Then the do this lil' <br/>
car search to make sure you have no bombs are drugs and ask where you <br/>
are going. It is a lil' two minute thing. I've thought about putting <br/>
them out toward Medicine Cliff and places like that. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, everyone - I normally just lurk on this list, but felt I'd chime<br/>
in on this one.  <br/>
<br/>
I work at a VA Medical Center (Hines, IL), which is actually it's own<br/>
"city" (as opposed to being located within a municipality's<br/>
jurisdiction).  The Hines Police are federal officers, and they were<br/>
guarding our entrances 24/7 until about a year ago (now they just<br/>
guard evenings/nights/weekends). In these post-9/11 days, I think the<br/>
government would definitely frown upon a letterbox hidden on<br/>
government property, particularly a military base.<br/>
