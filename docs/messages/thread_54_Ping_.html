I need to plan another trip out your way...it's a matter of time and<br/>

Hey, you know what?  I'm such a mo-ran.  I can't figure out how to post<br/>
on the Mid-MO blog.  I can find where to reply, but can't find "post"<br/>
or "help".  If/when you get a chance, could you email me a helpful<br/>
link?<br/>
<br/>
I got my two replacement boxes done and planted for Tower Grove, and<br/>
planted one other one on a 3-mile hike in West Tyson Park this past<br/>
weekend, that will be listed as soon as I get the clues written<br/>
(probably this weekend).  Have you ever been there?  It's SO pretty!<br/>
<br/>
Hey you other Mid-Westerners...if you ever come to Missouri, plan a<br/>
trip to Columbia and Fulton.  Lnd-Crzr here, as well as several other<br/>
folks, have some AMAZING boxes planted.  He's a freakin' artist!<br/>

that I hate to post the clues.  Kinda want to protect them.  Who knows, <br/>
maybe someday I'll post them, but for now I wait until someone kinda proves <br/>
themselves by planting their own and .  I'll break P100 with this big series <br/>
coming up.  It will be released (?) at the winter gatheirng.  Won't be a lot <br/>
of boxing going on at the gatheirng, but more a social with a few surprises. <br/>
  I do HIGHLY recommend coming to the Spring gatheinrg.  If you missed <br/>
Bilbo's adventures before, you'll certainly not want to miss what's next.<br/>
<br/>
Mid-MO does seem a bit quiet recently.  but I think everyone left the Fall <br/>
gatheirng charged and they're all working on projects.  I'm about to post <br/>
the clues from the FF Tome Vol II which will add 11 to the local scene.<br/>

&gt; What kind words Roze!  <br/>
<br/>
Pshaw - it's all true!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The trouble with doing such time intensive LBs<br/>
&gt; is that I hate to post the clues.  Kinda want to protect them.  <br/>
<br/>
*snicker*  I recently wrote some doggerel about this very subject. <br/>
Ready for some bad verse?  Before we go there, I'll just say that I<br/>
think your clues are tricky enough that your boxes will be pretty safe<br/>
from most "problem" boxers.  Add a nice long hike or two, and viola! <br/>
They'll be fine (but don't post them till I find them, m'kay? ;-) <br/>
Also, you've got SO many out there that ARE listed - you're like<br/>
Missouri's premier letterboxer!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   I do HIGHLY recommend coming to the Spring gatheinrg.  If you<br/>
&gt; missed <br/>
&gt; Bilbo's adventures before, you'll certainly not want to miss what's<br/>
&gt; next.<br/>
<br/>
When is that again?  I hope it's not May 23 - June 17 (during the<br/>
Shakespeare Festival run; my busiest time of year at work).<br/>
<br/>
I planted one on the Chubb trail this weekend; haven't had time to<br/>
finalize the clues yet, but hopefully will post it this weekend.  Have<br/>
you been there? It's lovely!  Just watch out for mountain bikers.<br/>
<br/>
*Ahem*<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
The stamp came out so fine.<br/>
In great detail I carved it out,<br/>
And didnt miss a line.<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
The logs a work of art.<br/>
Ive double-bagged it in the box;<br/>
It shouldnt fall apart.<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
The hiding place is pretty!<br/>
A scenic hike, a county park<br/>
Not too far from the city.<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
The clues I wrote are hard,<br/>
(THAT should keep the noobs away.)<br/>
In verse form  Im a bard!<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
Shall I post it on AQ?<br/>
But what if someone seeks it out<br/>
Who dont know what to do?<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
Off-line Ill keep the clues!<br/>
So only those who contact me<br/>
Will get location news.<br/>
<br/>
What if thats not secure enough?<br/>
Im frightened for it now.<br/>
What if the baggie goes unsealed?<br/>
What if its eaten by a cow?<br/>
<br/>
What if a band of newbies<br/>
With kids and dogs in tow<br/>
Shout out I found the letterbox!<br/>
For all the world to know?<br/>
<br/>
What if theyre more experienced,<br/>
But careless just one time?<br/>
What if the lids not put on right<br/>
And the box fills up with grime?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could go postal<br/>
And mail it around.<br/>
But even then it could get lost!<br/>
No, that ideas not sound.<br/>
<br/>
I made a little letterbox.<br/>
Its sitting on my shelf.<br/>
The worlds a big and scary place.<br/>
Ill just keep it for myself.<br/>

<br/>
I can't go ANYWHERE in June - the Shakespeare Festival I work for runs<br/>
Memorial Day weekend thru Father's day.  I tend to take vacation in<br/>
late July or August - this year, I changed it and took 2 weeks in<br/>
Sept/Oct to 1) attend a friend's wedding on 9/30 and then 2) attend the<br/>
DE Games (which was a blast-and-a-half!).<br/>
<br/>
Are you planning to attend the Pub Crawl?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a St. Nick gathering planned for WI this Saturday.  Too bad<br/>

<br/>
I have no doubt, tho, that you and Martini Man will be out there, in<br/>
the snow, digging around! :-)  I was thinking about maybe trying to<br/>
attend, but the cosmic convergence of time &amp; money is just not gonna<br/>
happen until at least after the new year...<br/>
<br/>
Stay safe out there honey!  TTFN!<br/>

&gt;I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt;Shall I post it on AQ?<br/>
&gt;But what if someone seeks it out<br/>
&gt;Who dont know what to do?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt;Off-line Ill keep the clues!<br/>
&gt;So only those who contact me<br/>
&gt;Will get location news.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What if thats not secure enough?<br/>
&gt;Im frightened for it now.<br/>
&gt;What if the baggie goes unsealed?<br/>
&gt;What if its eaten by a cow?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What if a band of newbies<br/>
&gt;With kids and dogs in tow<br/>
&gt;Shout out I found the letterbox!<br/>
&gt;For all the world to know?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What if theyre more experienced,<br/>
&gt;But careless just one time?<br/>
&gt;What if the lids not put on right<br/>
&gt;And the box fills up with grime?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess I could go postal<br/>
&gt;And mail it around.<br/>
&gt;But even then it could get lost!<br/>
&gt;No, that ideas not sound.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt;Its sitting on my shelf.<br/>
&gt;The worlds a big and scary place.<br/>
&gt;Ill just keep it for myself.<br/>

by you?<br/>

&gt; What great verse!  So is there truly a box you're keeping secret that<br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; only gets the clues directly from you?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Pshaw - it's all true!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The trouble with doing such time intensive LBs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is that I hate to post the clues.  Kinda want to protect them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;*snicker*  I recently wrote some doggerel about this very subject.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ready for some bad verse?  Before we go there, I'll just say that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;think your clues are tricky enough that your boxes will be pretty<br/>
&gt; safe<br/>
&gt; &gt;from most "problem" boxers.  Add a nice long hike or two, and viola!<br/>
&gt; &gt;They'll be fine (but don't post them till I find them, m'kay? ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also, you've got SO many out there that ARE listed - you're like<br/>
&gt; &gt;Missouri's premier letterboxer!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;   I do HIGHLY recommend coming to the Spring gatheinrg.  If you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; missed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bilbo's adventures before, you'll certainly not want to miss<br/>
&gt; what's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; next.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;When is that again?  I hope it's not May 23 - June 17 (during the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Shakespeare Festival run; my busiest time of year at work).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I planted one on the Chubb trail this weekend; haven't had time to<br/>
&gt; &gt;finalize the clues yet, but hopefully will post it this weekend. <br/>
&gt; Have<br/>
&gt; &gt;you been there? It's lovely!  Just watch out for mountain bikers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;*Ahem*<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The stamp came out so fine.<br/>
&gt; &gt;In great detail I carved it out,<br/>
&gt; &gt;And didnt miss a line.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The logs a work of art.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ive double-bagged it in the box;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It shouldnt fall apart.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The hiding place is pretty!<br/>
&gt; &gt;A scenic hike, a county park<br/>
&gt; &gt;Not too far from the city.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I made a little letterbox.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The clues I wrote are hard,<br/>
&gt; &gt;(THAT should keep the noobs away.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;In verse form  Im a bard!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I made a little letterbox.<br/>
