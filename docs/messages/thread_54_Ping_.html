I need to plan another trip out your way...it's a matter of time and<br>
money coming together in a cosmic convergence.  I'll def be in touch<br>
before setting out tho.<br>
<br>
Hey, you know what?  I'm such a mo-ran.  I can't figure out how to post<br>
on the Mid-MO blog.  I can find where to reply, but can't find "post"<br>
or "help".  If/when you get a chance, could you email me a helpful<br>
link?<br>
<br>
I got my two replacement boxes done and planted for Tower Grove, and<br>
planted one other one on a 3-mile hike in West Tyson Park this past<br>
weekend, that will be listed as soon as I get the clues written<br>
(probably this weekend).  Have you ever been there?  It's SO pretty!<br>
<br>
Hey you other Mid-Westerners...if you ever come to Missouri, plan a<br>
trip to Columbia and Fulton.  Lnd-Crzr here, as well as several other<br>
folks, have some AMAZING boxes planted.  He's a freakin' artist!<br>

that I hate to post the clues.  Kinda want to protect them.  Who knows, <br>
maybe someday I'll post them, but for now I wait until someone kinda proves <br>
themselves by planting their own and .  I'll break P100 with this big series <br>
coming up.  It will be released (?) at the winter gatheirng.  Won't be a lot <br>
of boxing going on at the gatheirng, but more a social with a few surprises. <br>
  I do HIGHLY recommend coming to the Spring gatheinrg.  If you missed <br>
Bilbo's adventures before, you'll certainly not want to miss what's next.<br>
<br>
Mid-MO does seem a bit quiet recently.  but I think everyone left the Fall <br>
gatheirng charged and they're all working on projects.  I'm about to post <br>
the clues from the FF Tome Vol II which will add 11 to the local scene.<br>

*snicker*  I recently wrote some doggerel about this very subject. <br>
Ready for some bad verse?  Before we go there, I'll just say that I<br>
think your clues are tricky enough that your boxes will be pretty safe<br>
from most "problem" boxers.  Add a nice long hike or two, and viola! <br>
They'll be fine (but don't post them till I find them, m'kay? ;-) <br>
Also, you've got SO many out there that ARE listed - you're like<br>
Missouri's premier letterboxer!<br>

<br>
When is that again?  I hope it's not May 23 - June 17 (during the<br>
Shakespeare Festival run; my busiest time of year at work).<br>
<br>
I planted one on the Chubb trail this weekend; haven't had time to<br>
finalize the clues yet, but hopefully will post it this weekend.  Have<br>
you been there? It's lovely!  Just watch out for mountain bikers.<br>
<br>
*Ahem*<br>
<br>
I made a little letterbox.<br>
The stamp came out so fine.<br>
In great detail I carved it out,<br>
And didnt miss a line.<br>
<br>
I made a little letterbox.<br>
The logs a work of art.<br>
Ive double-bagged it in the box;<br>
It shouldnt fall apart.<br>
<br>
I made a little letterbox.<br>
The hiding place is pretty!<br>
A scenic hike, a county park<br>
Not too far from the city.<br>
<br>
I made a little letterbox.<br>
The clues I wrote are hard,<br>
(THAT should keep the noobs away.)<br>
In verse form  Im a bard!<br>

I made a little letterbox.<br>
Shall I post it on AQ?<br>
But what if someone seeks it out<br>
Who dont know what to do?<br>

Off-line Ill keep the clues!<br>
So only those who contact me<br>
Will get location news.<br>

What if thats not secure enough?<br>
Im frightened for it now.<br>
What if the baggie goes unsealed?<br>
What if its eaten by a cow?<br>
<br>
What if a band of newbies<br>
With kids and dogs in tow<br>
Shout out I found the letterbox!<br>
For all the world to know?<br>
<br>
What if theyre more experienced,<br>
But careless just one time?<br>
What if the lids not put on right<br>
And the box fills up with grime?<br>
<br>
I guess I could go postal<br>
And mail it around.<br>
But even then it could get lost!<br>
No, that ideas not sound.<br>
<br>
I made a little letterbox.<br>
Its sitting on my shelf.<br>
The worlds a big and scary place.<br>
Ill just keep it for myself.<br>

<br>
I can't go ANYWHERE in June - the Shakespeare Festival I work for runs<br>
Memorial Day weekend thru Father's day.  I tend to take vacation in<br>
late July or August - this year, I changed it and took 2 weeks in<br>
Sept/Oct to 1) attend a friend's wedding on 9/30 and then 2) attend the<br>
DE Games (which was a blast-and-a-half!).<br>
<br>
Are you planning to attend the Pub Crawl?<br>

I have no doubt, tho, that you and Martini Man will be out there, in<br>
the snow, digging around! :-)  I was thinking about maybe trying to<br>
attend, but the cosmic convergence of time & money is just not gonna<br>
happen until at least after the new year...<br>
<br>
Stay safe out there honey!  TTFN!<br>
