                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are the Shakespeare Festival of St. Louis.  Each year since 2001, we<br/>
have constructed a set from the ground up in Forest Park, just east of<br/>
Art Hill (between the art museum and the zoo).  We cast national and<br/>
local talent, both Equity and non.  Then, weather permitting, we have<br/>
23 nights (every night at 8PM except Tuesdays) of free Shakespeare for<br/>
anyone who cares to come.  I believe our one-night attendence record is<br/>
around 5,400 people!  This was a Thursday night, after several days of<br/>
rain when attendance dropped to just a few hundred folks, and the<br/>
forecast for the upcoming (final) weekend was not looking too<br/>
promising...<br/>
<br/>
I always recommend folks plan to come early in the run rather than wait<br/>
till the end, just in case the weather turns.  Last year, we only had<br/>
one rain-out, plus a couple of delayed starts.  At that time of year,<br/>
we tend to get a lot of late-afternoon thunderstorms, which makes for a<br/>
fun day in the office:<br/>
<br/>
Phone: "Ring-ring."<br/>
Me: "Shakespeare Festival of St. Louis."<br/>
Phone: "Hi, are you planning to have a show tonight?  I mean, with the<br/>
rain and all."<br/>
Me: "We make every attempt to perform each night.  In case of inclement<br/>
weather, we could delay the start of the show up to one hour. As long<br/>
as we can keep the stage dry and conditions safe for the performers and<br/>
crew, we will have a show.  Please plan to bring chairs, or at least a<br/>
tarp to put your blanket on, as the ground will be wet."<br/>
<br/>
I get to make this speech many many many times each day the weather<br/>
threatens...I spend a lot of time looking at the hourly forecast on<br/>
weather.com!<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, here is the website: www.sfstl.com.  It's not a<br/>
very good website, but we're working on it!  <br/>
<br/>
I've got a very nice drawing of Shakespeare that I'm planning to use<br/>
for one stamp, but kind of want to figure out some images that relate<br/>
more to this specific play, which is basically just two convoluted love<br/>
stories.  I really need to sit down and read it thru and see what<br/>
strikes my fancy, which (now that we have the director's cut of the<br/>
script) I plan to start on during the holidays!<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Why don't you head out for the Pub Crawl event in VA in June?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; I can't go ANYWHERE in June - the Shakespeare Festival I work<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt;   &gt; runs <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; Memorial Day weekend thru Father's day. ...<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; Are you planning to attend the Pub Crawl? <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Yes, we are. I think it will be on JUN 23, which is the weekend<br/>
&gt;   &gt; AFTER Father's Day....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Alas, things are still quite hectic the week after we close. It<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt;   doesn't settle down for about a month, and now, with all the new<br/>
&gt;   education programs we've got going on, it's busy even then. We<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt;   need to petition our board of directors to add staff. But it's all<br/>
&gt;   good - I love my job and my organization, and since I get 3 - count<br/>
&gt; 'em<br/>
&gt;   3 - weeks of vacation each year (plus we close the office the week<br/>
&gt;   between xmas and new year's) I can't really complain about not<br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt;   time off in May or June. (Obviously, we also don't get Memorial Day<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt;   a holiday.) I will def. be planning to hit another gather sometime<br/>
&gt;   next year; just waiting at this point to see what's going on where.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If you're interested, you should come down during the run - we are<br/>
&gt;   working hard to become one of the premier Shakespeare companies in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;   country. At this time, we're kind of locked into a single-play,<br/>
&gt; 3-1/2<br/>
&gt;   week run (due to other committments in the park) but we're looking<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt;   expansion opportunities for '08. This year's show will be "Much Ado<br/>
&gt;   About Nothing". Oh! And since I've shared my "new addiction" with<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt;   co-workers, I've been charged with creating "Much Ado" themed<br/>
&gt;   letterboxes for part of the kid's activities during our pre-play<br/>
&gt; Green<br/>
&gt;   Show! Not quite sure what those are gonna be yet...any thoughts?<br/>
