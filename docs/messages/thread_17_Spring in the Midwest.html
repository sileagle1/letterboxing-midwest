haven't gotten to do much boxing.<br>
<br>
I was wondering, how many of you plan your boxes to fit a series, for<br>
ex. Indian Tribes, Flowers, Months of the Year whatever?<br>
<br>
How many of you just randomly put them out?<br>
<br>
How many of you make them fit the area you're hiding in?<br>
<br>
I'm starting a series on "Festivals of Oklahoma."  I got this idea<br>
from some boxes in Texas.  Either as we attend the various festivals<br>
in Oklahoma or as a follow-up later I'm going to plant a box.<br>
<br>
My goal for this year is to attend at least 8 festivals.<br>
<br>
What about your current plans for boxes?<br>

<br>
I have several series of boxes (birding trail, TX Musicians,<br>
beer, etc), but my Lewis & Clark series is partly in the<br>
Midwest area, so many of you should be able to find them.<br>
<br>
> How many of you just randomly put them out?<br>
<br>
I rarely just put one out that has nothing to do with the<br>
area, but I do keep a few on hand just in case I really<br>
like an area while traveling and don't have time to carve.<br>
<br>
> How many of you make them fit the area you're hiding in?<br>
<br>
Most of mine are planned ahead to fit an area I plan to visit.<br>
The down side of this is that once I get there I sometimes<br>
have trouble finding a good hiding place.<br>
<br>

<br>
I think this is a great idea and I hope to get up that way<br>
some day and find some of them (along with others in OK).<br>
 <br>
> My goal for this year is to attend at least 8 festivals.<br>
<br>
That is quite ambitious but sounds fun.  I hope to make<br>
at least 3 in TX.<br>
<br>
> What about your current plans for boxes?<br>
<br>
I hope to place boxes in at least 5 new States this year.<br>
I have been to all 50 States, but most before my Letterboxing<br>
days.  Time to revisit as I get the chance, but this time<br>
going to new places I only know about through letterboxing.<br>
<br>
I sure would like for more people on this list to start<br>
participating, so let's hear from you!<br>
