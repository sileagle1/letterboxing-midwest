                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all. My name is Lock Wench and I am planning a planting (and <br>
finding!) event for North Dakota in May 2007. After noticing that <br>
North Dakota had fewer letterboxes than any other state, some <br>
friends and I started talking about remedying that. I put out some <br>
feelers on the bigger lists and was shocked and amazed at the <br>
response. It ran about 99% positive, with lots of people offering to <br>
send boxes if they couldn't go there themselves, some people signing <br>
up right away even though it is a year from now! and 1% concerned <br>
that the boxes would languish and not be maintained.<br>
<br>
People from the west and east coast who have boxed with me know what <br>
a freak I am about doing things 150%, so they chuckled at that last <br>
one.  When I am challenged, it makes me even more determined! On <br>
that note, I want you to know that I have been in contact with <br>
representatives from the Chamber of Commerce of Fargo, North Dakota, <br>
and am working to set up a two day event to include free instruction <br>
for newboxers, a planting frenzy..and a big search to wrap up the <br>
weekend. <br>
<br>
I would really appreciate it if any North Dakota boxers could <br>
contact me to help me coordinate the little details. Come spread a <br>
little letterboxing love! Feel free to forward this post. Thanks!<br>

We did something similar to this last year in Texas. <br>
There were three counties adjacent to one another<br>
without a single box in any of them.  We had a<br>
gathering with the purpose of focusing on planting in<br>
those three counties.  Some folks couldn't come for<br>
the gathering, but they sent boxes ahead for others to<br>
plant.  Some folks couldn't come that weekend, so they<br>
planted at another time.  That area now has 23 boxes,<br>
less than one year after the event.  We all agreed<br>
that we would all do maintenance as we could and as we<br>
were near or passing through that area.<br>
<br>
We styled it as a "barnraising" - a community event in<br>
the American frontier as settlers moved to a new area<br>
and had to get set to go quickly.  Because none of us<br>
were from that area, I did tons of research and posted<br>
it to webpages on the event as I found interesting<br>
things so folks could refer to my website for ideas<br>
for boxes.  Of course, because letterboxers tend to be<br>
very compulsive, most of the attendees also did their<br>
own research!<br>
<br>
The one thing I am disappointed about from the<br>
gathering is that we haven't developed more boxers in<br>
that area.  We still only have a small handful that<br>
live in those counties.  However, we did nothing to<br>
encourage new boxers, thinking that the boxes would be<br>
in place for the eventual moment when they show up.  <br>
<br>
I realize publicity and so forth is very<br>
controversial, but one simple local article made a<br>
huge difference in my own area.  We went in my county<br>
from 3 boxes at the end of 2003 to 47 today.  A good<br>
reporter can surely make a big difference!<br>
<br>
If you are interested in taking a look at our event,<br>
the pages are still posted at:<br>
<br>
www.geocities.com/barefootlucy/JENBarnraising <br>
<br>
You are planning a much more complex affair, but maybe<br>
you can get an idea or two!<br>
<br>
Also, I would love to send the event box from our<br>
barnraising to your planting event next year, so if<br>
you are interested in having it, put it on your list<br>
and let me know when you want me to send it along.<br>
<br>
Good luck and have fun putting it together!<br>

A barn raising is exactly the tone I want to convey for the Fargo <br>
event. I enjoyed looking at your link (thank you!) and agree that <br>
preparation will be key. I really admire how you did so much research. <br>
I have been doing the same thing, to get ideas for boxes. The Fargo <br>
event will be just a little different as we will connect more with the <br>
locals for help in planting areas...and to hopefully kickstart some <br>
boxing. <br>
<br>
Education in letterboxing etiquette, leave no trace, respecting <br>
private property etc will be paramount. <br>
<br>
I would love to have your box at the event and would consider taking <br>
it anytime after April 1, 2007. Thank you for your generosity.<br>
