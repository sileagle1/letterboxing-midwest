<br/>
A link to their policy can be found on the LbNA Park Policy Page:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/Policy.php#MO<br/>
<br/>
Message from MDC:<br/>
The listing you have posted for MDC refers only to groups of more  <br/>
than 10 people needing to get a Special Use Permit to take part in  <br/>
certain activities on conservation areas.  This is an existing  <br/>
regulation in our Wildlife Code.  Additionally, a new Geocaching/ <br/>
Letterboxing policy took effect in March, 2009.  This policy  <br/>
requires that anyone wishing to place a container (geocache or  <br/>
letterbox) on a conservation area must first request a Special Use  <br/>
Permit from the area manager.  If approved, the person placing the  <br/>
container must comply with a list of Conditions and Considerations,  <br/>
in addition to the standard rules attached to a Special Use Permit.   <br/>
There are restrictions including no more than 2 Special Use Permits  <br/>
per person on any approved conservation area.  There is no charge  <br/>
for a permit and the permit is good for one year at a time.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried to get this information out to many of the geocachers  <br/>
in Missouri and on geocaching.com.   However, I don’t think the new  <br/>
policy has been shared with letterboxers.  With numerous fish,  <br/>
forest and wildlife management activities taking place on MDC areas,  <br/>
it is essential that the manager approve placement of any container  <br/>
and know of the locations.  In scanning the web site I notice many  <br/>
letterboxes on conservation areas with no indication that Special  <br/>
Use Permits have been obtained.  So essentially these are all  <br/>
“illegal” and would be considered littering which is a violation of  <br/>
the Wildlife Code of Missouri (subject to a fine), and can be  <br/>
confiscated by area staff or Conservation Agents.  But don’t be  <br/>
alarmed, it is not likely that they would be!  We encourage  <br/>
geocaching and letterboxing on our areas when and where appropriate,  <br/>
if it does not conflict with our mission and primary uses of our  <br/>
areas.  It’s a great way to get kids and families outdoors to enjoy  <br/>
nature and trails, different habitats, etc.  However, as we do now  <br/>
require permits for this, what is a good way to get the word out so  <br/>
that everyone can be in compliance?<br/>
