missed Oklahoma. Sure was anticipating seeing it listed. Gonna have to <br>
come back this way and check us out. I am partial of course to the <br>
Northeast corner of it, but I am sure others would attest to other <br>
parts too. Tulsa is a great city, that's where I hail from. Made a <br>
little trip back in '58 to Jacksonville, Fl and know it is pretty <br>
there. The ocean is what I remember best, and how I would love to go <br>
back. Ahhh...memories. <br>
Good luck on getting all those stamps made and have fun planting too. <br>
Box on, <br>
