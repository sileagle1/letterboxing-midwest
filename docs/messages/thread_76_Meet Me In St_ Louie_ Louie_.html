<br/>
I just talked to geckospot; since the convention is September 27-29, <br/>
she would love it if you would consider Saturday, September 22 OR <br/>
Sunday, September 23 (is Sunday an option for you?) for the STL <br/>
gather.  She'd plan to fly in on Friday so we'd have plenty of time to <br/>
make ready.  She also said she'd bring a couple/few things to plant - <br/>
yay!  I'm taking the week off from work, and we'll be boxing and <br/>
camping and camping and boxing all week, then I'll settle in at home <br/>
while she convenes, confers, converses, and otherwise hob-nobs with her <br/>
fellow wizards - er, I mean, petsitters.<br/>
<br/>
So now you know too much of our plans.  Fingers X'd that 9/22 or 9/23 <br/>
works out!<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email off-group to discuss themes, stamps / logs / boxes <br/>
you want me to help with, venue - anything at all!  Forest Park would <br/>
be a fine place to gather, unless you want something more "rustic".  <br/>
Maybe Babler?  There are some nice big shelters there so we'd be snug <br/>
as bugs (or bees? :-) in the event of rain...<br/>
<br/>
I'm all excited now!  Thank you SO MUCH for organizing this - my <br/>
natural tendency towards slackardness kept me from taking it this far, <br/>
so I commend you!  Huzzah!  :-D<br/>
