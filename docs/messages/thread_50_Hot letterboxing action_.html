                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings friends!  I just got back from a frantic week of <br/>
letterboxing with my Mid-Atlantic friends, at the DE Games at <br/>
Killen's Pond State Park.  Wow - what an event!  Sewsowbizzy planted <br/>
over 70 boxes, and participants were given only one week to find as <br/>
many as they could - it was a blast!<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm back home in St. Louis, and wondering, what next?  There are <br/>
SO few boxes around my area.  Yes, I'm going to plant some more over <br/>
the next few months, but seriously - how does one generate <br/>
interest?  Any ideas? <br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to make my way mid-state in the next month or so; there <br/>
are loads of boxes to be had in Columbia and Fulton.  But I'm about <br/>
tapped out on finds within an hour of home...I'm not jonesing yet, <br/>
but you know how it is when the letterboxing itch needs scratching!<br/>
<br/>
Also, another question - if I were to host an event in the Lou', <br/>
would y'all attend?  What would you be interested in seeing at said <br/>
event?<br/>

it out there.  I'm expecting in excess of 30 people.  We're doing workshops <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the scoop on the 11/4 event - do I need to sign up, or just<br/>
show up?  It sounds great - I really enjoy the arts &amp; crafts aspect of<br/>
LBing, and would love to learn from some experts!  Do you traditionally<br/>
host something at this time of year?  I was kind of thinking fall 2007<br/>
for something in the Lou' (my job precludes anything in the spring, and<br/>
summer here is just miserable) and I wouldn't want to intrude on any<br/>
pre-existing events.<br/>
<br/>
Dragonskald has changed his name to Tipsy Bard, and yes, his<br/>
"Ever-Fixed Mark" box is back in place - I rescued it for him this<br/>
spring, as the box had lost it's water-proof integrity and the log was<br/>
ruined.  He planted a second box called "Sunny Softshell" but it didn't<br/>
last; it went missing after about the first month and he has yet to<br/>
replace it.  I may do it for him...I've got the impression of the<br/>
original stamp, and would try to do a better camo job than he did<br/>
originally. (His clues are excellent and tricky poems, but he's the<br/>
first to admit that his carving needs work!  We're planning to someday<br/>
collaborate, when life allows.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm still quite the newbie - only started this past April - and I just<br/>
wish I lived somewhere with more boxes so I can just keep going and<br/>
going!  I've been to Delaware (grew up there, don't ya know) twice<br/>
since I started, and there's SO MANY boxes in that area.  Makes me<br/>
jealous!<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate both the invitation to your event and the offer of<br/>
assistance in planning one for St. Louis!  Forest Park would be great<br/>
and very appropriate if I go with "Meet Me In St. Louie, Louie" for a<br/>
theme.  I also have 8 boxes planted in Tower Grove Park, which is also<br/>
very lovely and has free pavilion rental (plus it's a short bike ride<br/>
from home).<br/>
<br/>
Ok, Project Talk-The-BF-Into-a-Letterboxing-Weekend begins tonight! <br/>
I'll be in touch thru the blog.  Thanks again!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Back to a St Louis gatheirng, I think Forest Park would be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful<br/>
&gt; &gt; place.  I think there used to be (still?) a couple of LBs w/ great<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues by<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dragonskald (?).  Has anyone ever found those, or know if they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; still<br/>
&gt; &gt; active?  I'd be more than willing to help plan/organize a gathering<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; you.  The up-coming gatehirng in Columbia will be the fourth I've<br/>
&gt; &gt; organized.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I should warn you, this won;t be the big, grand LB adventure I do in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Spring.  This is more focused on the arts and crafts that go into LB.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Folks<br/>
&gt; &gt; have asked for a workshop gatheirng like this for some time, so I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; throwing<br/>
&gt; &gt; it out there.  I'm expecting in excess of 30 people.  We're doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; workshops<br/>
&gt; &gt; on book binding, paper alteration, codes &amp; ciphers and carving.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Whew!  Take care!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 10 Oct 2006 20:32:05 -0000<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Greetings friends!  I just got back from a frantic week of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;letterboxing with my Mid-Atlantic friends, at the DE Games at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Killen's Pond State Park.  Wow - what an event!  Sewsowbizzy planted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;over 70 boxes, and participants were given only one week to find as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;many as they could - it was a blast!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Now I'm back home in St. Louis, and wondering, what next?  There are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;SO few boxes around my area.  Yes, I'm going to plant some more over<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the next few months, but seriously - how does one generate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;interest?  Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm hoping to make my way mid-state in the next month or so; there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;are loads of boxes to be had in Columbia and Fulton.  But I'm about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;tapped out on finds within an hour of home...I'm not jonesing yet,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;but you know how it is when the letterboxing itch needs scratching!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Also, another question - if I were to host an event in the Lou',<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;would y'all attend?  What would you be interested in seeing at said<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;event?<br/>
