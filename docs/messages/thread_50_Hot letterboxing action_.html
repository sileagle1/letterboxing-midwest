                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings friends!  I just got back from a frantic week of <br>
letterboxing with my Mid-Atlantic friends, at the DE Games at <br>
Killen's Pond State Park.  Wow - what an event!  Sewsowbizzy planted <br>
over 70 boxes, and participants were given only one week to find as <br>
many as they could - it was a blast!<br>
<br>
Now I'm back home in St. Louis, and wondering, what next?  There are <br>
SO few boxes around my area.  Yes, I'm going to plant some more over <br>
the next few months, but seriously - how does one generate <br>
interest?  Any ideas? <br>
<br>
I'm hoping to make my way mid-state in the next month or so; there <br>
are loads of boxes to be had in Columbia and Fulton.  But I'm about <br>
tapped out on finds within an hour of home...I'm not jonesing yet, <br>
but you know how it is when the letterboxing itch needs scratching!<br>
<br>
Also, another question - if I were to host an event in the Lou', <br>
would y'all attend?  What would you be interested in seeing at said <br>
event?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would certainly be up for a trip to St. Louis for a gatheirng and I'm <br>
certain Fox-Fyr would as well.  Proably a few of the others from the Mid-MO <br>
community as well.  Of course finding a time when everyone's schedules jive <br>
is the rough part.<br>
<br>
I'm hosting the Mid-MO Fall Arts & Crafts Gatheirng on Nov 4 in Columbia if <br>
you'd like to come down and meet the wonderful community we have.  More <br>
infor at C2B2's site www.midmoletterboxing.blogspot.com .  Browse through <br>
the archives too if you haven't before.  Lots of good infor on how our scene <br>
has developed.<br>
<br>
As far as getting more boxes in your area, I think it's one of those things <br>
that just can't be pushed.  There's lots of publicity out about LB recently <br>
(Games magazine just ran a good article) and so more folks are finding the <br>
hobby, but as far as getting folks to plant, that is something they have to <br>
do on their own.  certainly encouraging them is worth the effort.  I have a <br>
few seceret series that I only give out clues to folks who have hidden 5 LBs <br>
in the area.  But I don't think this has encouraged more boxes because I <br>
keep the whole thing tightly under wraps and spring it on them once they <br>
fufill the criteria.<br>
<br>
We (Mid-MO) just got lucky and have built a fantastic LB community, that <br>
continues to grow by leaps and bounds.  To me, that is part of the magic of <br>
LB.<br>
<br>
Back to a St Louis gatheirng, I think Forest Park would be a wonderful <br>
place.  I think there used to be (still?) a couple of LBs w/ great clues by <br>
Dragonskald (?).  Has anyone ever found those, or know if they are still <br>
active?  I'd be more than willing to help plan/organize a gathering with <br>
you.  The up-coming gatehirng in Columbia will be the fourth I've organized.<br>
<br>
I should warn you, this won;t be the big, grand LB adventure I do in the <br>
Spring.  This is more focused on the arts and crafts that go into LB.  Folks <br>
have asked for a workshop gatheirng like this for some time, so I'm throwing <br>
it out there.  I'm expecting in excess of 30 people.  We're doing workshops <br>
on book binding, paper alteration, codes & ciphers and carving.<br>
<br>
Whew!  Take care!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Lnd-Crzr,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the scoop on the 11/4 event - do I need to sign up, or just<br>
show up?  It sounds great - I really enjoy the arts & crafts aspect of<br>
LBing, and would love to learn from some experts!  Do you traditionally<br>
host something at this time of year?  I was kind of thinking fall 2007<br>
for something in the Lou' (my job precludes anything in the spring, and<br>
summer here is just miserable) and I wouldn't want to intrude on any<br>
pre-existing events.<br>
<br>
Dragonskald has changed his name to Tipsy Bard, and yes, his<br>
"Ever-Fixed Mark" box is back in place - I rescued it for him this<br>
spring, as the box had lost it's water-proof integrity and the log was<br>
ruined.  He planted a second box called "Sunny Softshell" but it didn't<br>
last; it went missing after about the first month and he has yet to<br>
replace it.  I may do it for him...I've got the impression of the<br>
original stamp, and would try to do a better camo job than he did<br>
originally. (His clues are excellent and tricky poems, but he's the<br>
first to admit that his carving needs work!  We're planning to someday<br>
collaborate, when life allows.)<br>
<br>
I'm still quite the newbie - only started this past April - and I just<br>
wish I lived somewhere with more boxes so I can just keep going and<br>
going!  I've been to Delaware (grew up there, don't ya know) twice<br>
since I started, and there's SO MANY boxes in that area.  Makes me<br>
jealous!<br>
<br>
I really appreciate both the invitation to your event and the offer of<br>
assistance in planning one for St. Louis!  Forest Park would be great<br>
and very appropriate if I go with "Meet Me In St. Louie, Louie" for a<br>
theme.  I also have 8 boxes planted in Tower Grove Park, which is also<br>
very lovely and has free pavilion rental (plus it's a short bike ride<br>
from home).<br>
<br>
Ok, Project Talk-The-BF-Into-a-Letterboxing-Weekend begins tonight! <br>
I'll be in touch thru the blog.  Thanks again!<br>

anything, but I like to have a rough guess of how many will be attending.<br>
<br>
If you haven't take a look at the blog in April and May for a couple of <br>
articles and links to pictures of my last Spring Gathering.  I must say it <br>
was quite an affair and will be hard to top for the next spring, however, I <br>
am already working on it and so far it is looking fantastic.  The annual <br>
Spring Gatheirng is when I really try to blow everyones socks off.<br>
<br>
If you do manage a LB weekend, let us know and we'll (the locals) set <br>
something up, maybe a picnic.<br>
<br>
take care!<br>
