                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there!<br>
<br>
Just wanted to take a minute to introduce myself - I'm<br>
BarefootLucy and I'm from Northeast Texas.  I'll<br>
probably mostly lurk on here, but wanted to make<br>
myself known!<br>
<br>
I've been letterboxing in Texas for a little over two<br>
years and having a great time down here.  I ventured<br>
up to Tulsa a few weeks ago and enjoyed seeing all the<br>
new and different signature stamps - lots of fun!  I'm<br>
looking forward to learning more about boxing in other<br>
areas!<br>
<br>
Lucy<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WHAA-Hoo! Hi Stellena.  Nice to meet you.  I'm Paula, aka Goose Chaser <br>
and I'm an Iowa Letterboxer, from the Quad City area.  Did you recently <br>
place a box in Polk County?  I got that notice in my email today.  <br>
There's not a lot of us in Iowa.  I asked on another message board <br>
about how to get the hobby going in my area, and the biggest suggestion <br>
was to just plant lots and lots of boxes and hopefully somebody will <br>
take notice.  I've noticed that there's a really active group in Iowa <br>
City and I wonder if it's college students.  I was thinking about how <br>
to get something published about letterboxing, to get more interested, <br>
but I haven't done that yet.  Here's the other message board I read <br>
almost everyday. It's http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/  The <br>
messages are always entertaining, and it's a very active site.  If you <br>
have questions, it's a great place to get answers.  <br>
Welcome to LB!  Is Stellena your trail name?<br>

I have noticed a LOT of new boxes posted recently from Iowa! Looks like <br>
things are starting to develop...<br>
<br>
Since Iowa is right next door to Wisconsin, I wanted to let you know <br>
about a gathering in June.  It's the 4th annual gathering of the "Great <br>
Lakes" letterboxing region, but anyone is welcome to attend.  If you're <br>
feeling a bit lonely, and would like a chance to meet and talk with <br>
some other fellow-boxers, this might be a good opportunity to do so. <br>

Thanks for the invite.  I have actually looked at that gathering and <br>
have considered it.  However, June is already pretty packed for me <br>
with Girl Scout trips and camps.  I'm still wondering if I can <br>
squeeze it in.  It's nice to hear from a neighbor.  I think most of <br>
the boxers I've been communicating with through these groups are <br>
from eastern usa.  My hubby and I are in Wisconsin frequently and <br>
I've started printing clues to bring along on my next trip.  I've <br>
seen your name alot. It looks like Milwaukee will be my next <br>
destination and there's a bunch of boxes between here and there.  <br>
So, I hope I'll be stamping in one of your books soon.<br>

I'm with you about encouraging more boxers.  I think there is much<br>
concern about this with some that have been boxing for quite a while<br>
and their concerns are valid.<br>
<br>
However, I've often noticed that they are boxers in areas with many,<br>
many boxers and many, many boxes.<br>
Here in the midwest we're just excited to get to find anyone elses boxes.<br>
<br>
I think those are both excellent arenas to teach responsible boxing. <br>
One thing to keep in mind is not to refer to anyone else's boxes<br>
specifically unless they've given you permission.  This seems to<br>
bother some people and they are their creative property.<br>
<br>
Have fun and good luck.  I would also agree that after you've boxed<br>
for a few more months and found a variety of box types you'll be in a<br>
better position to help others learn.<br>
