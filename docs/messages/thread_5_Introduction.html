<br/>
Just wanted to take a minute to introduce myself - I'm<br/>
BarefootLucy and I'm from Northeast Texas.  I'll<br/>
probably mostly lurk on here, but wanted to make<br/>
myself known!<br/>
<br/>
I've been letterboxing in Texas for a little over two<br/>
years and having a great time down here.  I ventured<br/>
up to Tulsa a few weeks ago and enjoyed seeing all the<br/>
new and different signature stamps - lots of fun!  I'm<br/>
looking forward to learning more about boxing in other<br/>
areas!<br/>
<br/>

and I'm an Iowa Letterboxer, from the Quad City area.  Did you recently <br/>
place a box in Polk County?  I got that notice in my email today.  <br/>
There's not a lot of us in Iowa.  I asked on another message board <br/>
about how to get the hobby going in my area, and the biggest suggestion <br/>
was to just plant lots and lots of boxes and hopefully somebody will <br/>
take notice.  I've noticed that there's a really active group in Iowa <br/>
City and I wonder if it's college students.  I was thinking about how <br/>
to get something published about letterboxing, to get more interested, <br/>
but I haven't done that yet.  Here's the other message board I read <br/>
almost everyday. It's http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/  The <br/>
messages are always entertaining, and it's a very active site.  If you <br/>
have questions, it's a great place to get answers.  <br/>
Welcome to LB!  Is Stellena your trail name?<br/>

&gt; Hi!   Welcome to letterboxing!<br/>
&gt;   I'm from Illinois, but my in-laws live in Iowa so we visit there <br/>
often, (sister-in-law in Des Moines, father-in-law in Mason City) so <br/>
I might see you on the trails in Iowa sometime   :-)<br/>

I have noticed a LOT of new boxes posted recently from Iowa! Looks like <br/>
things are starting to develop...<br/>
<br/>
Since Iowa is right next door to Wisconsin, I wanted to let you know <br/>
about a gathering in June.  It's the 4th annual gathering of the "Great <br/>
Lakes" letterboxing region, but anyone is welcome to attend.  If you're <br/>
feeling a bit lonely, and would like a chance to meet and talk with <br/>
some other fellow-boxers, this might be a good opportunity to do so. <br/>

Thanks for the invite.  I have actually looked at that gathering and <br/>
have considered it.  However, June is already pretty packed for me <br/>
with Girl Scout trips and camps.  I'm still wondering if I can <br/>
squeeze it in.  It's nice to hear from a neighbor.  I think most of <br/>
the boxers I've been communicating with through these groups are <br/>
from eastern usa.  My hubby and I are in Wisconsin frequently and <br/>
I've started printing clues to bring along on my next trip.  I've <br/>
seen your name alot. It looks like Milwaukee will be my next <br/>
destination and there's a bunch of boxes between here and there.  <br/>
So, I hope I'll be stamping in one of your books soon.<br/>

&gt; WHAA-Hoo! Hi Stellena.  Nice to meet you.  I'm Paula, aka Goose Chaser <br/>
&gt; and I'm an Iowa Letterboxer, from the Quad City area.  Did you recently <br/>
&gt; place a box in Polk County?  I got that notice in my email today.  <br/>
&gt; There's not a lot of us in Iowa.  I asked on another message board <br/>
&gt; about how to get the hobby going in my area, and the biggest suggestion <br/>
&gt; was to just plant lots and lots of boxes and hopefully somebody will <br/>
&gt; take notice.  I've noticed that there's a really active group in Iowa <br/>
&gt; City and I wonder if it's college students.  I was thinking about how <br/>
&gt; to get something published about letterboxing, to get more interested, <br/>
&gt; but I haven't done that yet.  Here's the other message board I read <br/>
&gt; almost everyday. It's http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/  The <br/>
&gt; messages are always entertaining, and it's a very active site.  If you <br/>
&gt; have questions, it's a great place to get answers.  <br/>
&gt; Welcome to LB!  Is Stellena your trail name?<br/>

<br/>
I'm with you about encouraging more boxers.  I think there is much<br/>
concern about this with some that have been boxing for quite a while<br/>
and their concerns are valid.<br/>
<br/>
However, I've often noticed that they are boxers in areas with many,<br/>
many boxers and many, many boxes.<br/>
Here in the midwest we're just excited to get to find anyone elses boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I think those are both excellent arenas to teach responsible boxing. <br/>
One thing to keep in mind is not to refer to anyone else's boxes<br/>
specifically unless they've given you permission.  This seems to<br/>
bother some people and they are their creative property.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and good luck.  I would also agree that after you've boxed<br/>
for a few more months and found a variety of box types you'll be in a<br/>
better position to help others learn.<br/>
