LB Gathering.  The theme was pirates.  The location was Graham cave <br>
State park.  Many camped Friday, but things didn't officialy kick-off <br>
until Saturday morning. We had right at 50 people show up from the Mid-<br>
MO LB community and also two groups three groups from the KC area and <br>
four from the St Louis area.  The weather was perfect and the <br>
waterfalls were flowing.  About half camped Saturday night as we <br>
feasted on campfire roasted Fajitas and enjoyed wonderful <br>
entertainment by Fox-Fyr and  e-volution.  <br>

<br>
Hope to see you soon - maybe you can give a thought to visiting the<br>
Shakespeare Festival?  We open Friday, 5/25 and run nightly except<br>
Tuesdays till 6/17.  And it's free.  And if you haven't gotten it yet,<br>
there's a mystery box nearby...not mine, so I can't say any more.  <br>
<br>
At any rate, once the run opens, I'll be able to breath again.  I'm<br>
hoping to make at least one trip to the Fulton/Columbia area to box<br>
this summer, and my boxin' fool friend geckospot is visiting in<br>
September - so I'll see you sometime in the not too distant future!<br>
