                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone! Just wanted to drop in and say hello to our fellow <br>
boxers. I was reading an article in a magazine last month and <br>
thought that it would be a good idea to pass on to some of my former <br>
Girl Scout Leaders. You see, my oldest child is going into middle <br>
school and she decided that she was getting too old for Girl Scouts <br>
and wanted to try something else, anyway, I was talking to my <br>
husband about the article and mentioned that maybe I should call the <br>
council office. My children, ages 6, 9 and 12 overheard the <br>
conversation and asked if this was something that we could try as a <br>
new "mommy and me" project. I figured why not give it a try. What <br>
else can you do that educates the kids, gets them out of the house <br>
and working as a team, gets exercise for mom, and doesn't hardly <br>
cost a thing? So the very next day we went on our first find. Let me <br>
just say, we're hooked! The kids absolutely love figuring out the <br>
clues and learning some history about our hometown. We're from St. <br>
Joseph, MO. We just started about a month ago and we have already <br>
found 14 boxes. Now of course the kids are ready to plant their own <br>
box. The kids have decided to turn our "logbook" into a scrapbook, <br>
so we just stamp on plain white paper and we use the timer on our <br>
camera to take group pictures in cool spots around the trails, not <br>
giving away the plant location of course! I want to thank those of <br>
you who take the time and put out the effort to plant the boxes. It <br>
is becoming a wonderful experience for my children as well as myself <br>
and we tell everyone we know about our cool new activity! Happy <br>
boxing!<br>

I'm a  Girl Scout leader in Oklahoma for Cadet Scouts. The older <br>
girls have a Studio 2B patch that is a letter boxing patch that they <br>
can earn. I am glad your family is enjoying letterboxing. My kids <br>
love it and I am hoping my scouts do too.<br>

My family lives in Oklahoma and my husband is from St. Louis so we've<br>
got some finds in your state.<br>
<br>
I have a son 11 and daughter 7.  They enjoy the hunting most of the<br>
time but occasionally get that look that kids seem to be so good at.<br>
<br>
We've been boxing for almost 3 years and love that we've found<br>
something we can all do together outside.<br>
