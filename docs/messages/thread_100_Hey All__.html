<br/>
Well, I sitting here at my computer and it just hit me that I never <br/>
even thought of looking for a mid-west message board. So I looked and <br/>
found all of you :-)<br/>
<br/>
I've been a member of the Great Lakes board since early January and <br/>
have been boxing since November of last year. My wife, 4 kids and <br/>
myself have had loads of fun with this wonderful hobby and have logged <br/>
many miles/finds along the way.<br/>
<br/>
I scrolled down the membership list and saw several names I recognized -<br/>
- HEY Guys!! And many more that I didn't know. I very much look forward <br/>
to getting to know many of you over this board and perhaps meet up <br/>
someday (Maybe next May 3rd??).<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd drop a quick line and say 'Hiya.' again, we look <br/>
forwared to getting to know you.<br/>

<br/>
Nice to "meet" you!  Whereabouts do you live?  I'm in St. Louis - <br/>
drop a line if you are in the area sometime.<br/>
<br/>
This board does not see a lot of activity; I guess the midwest just <br/>
does not have the hot letterboxing action of other regions.  The <br/>
Columbia MO area boxers have their own blog and don't seem to venture <br/>
here much - LndCrzr will occasionally pop in with event info, but <br/>
that's about it.<br/>
<br/>
I really wanted to go to that May gather, but that is smack-dab in <br/>
the middle of my busiest time at work; I think I put in 60 hours that <br/>
week, and by the weekend, I just wanted to veg.  At least I didn't <br/>
have to work over the weekend as well!  So unless something changes <br/>
here at the office, I don't anticipate I'll ever get to the big <br/>
spring meet-up in Columbia.  I'm a sad panda.  ;-(  <br/>
<br/>
TTFN!<br/>

<div>WI Hiker, I'm so glad we met back in Feb. At least I have a face to put to 
yours (and Martini Man's) names on the screen. I must say I was most surprised 
to see you on the PNW board -- I'm now thinking you guys must belong to every 
message board out there :-) How you find time to keep up with them all, and 
actually participate, is beyond me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rosebud, we live in Moline, Illinois one of the Quad Cities right on the 
Iowa boarder. We love MO and have been to the top of the Arch (without getting 
stranded up there). We've been down to MO a handful of times, long before 
letterboxing was even on our radar screen. Perhaps the reason this board doesn't 
get much chatter is because mid-westerners are known for being laid back. I 
think we're just a quieter bunch of people :-)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know the Pitties have been down to the Columbia area and had a blast on 
their trip to MO, perhaps we'll do the same someday. Don't know about the event 
in St. Louis in Sept we are pretty booked up until mid-2008. There are about 4 
or 5 gatherings I would love to go to -- time and money are our limits, so I 
have to figure out which ones to eliminate :-( </div>
