<br/>
Our annual Winter BBQ is coming up on January 19, in Louisville, KY.  <br/>
If you're in the neighborhood, feel free to drop by.  Basically, <br/>
everyone meets up at the house at noon, then heads out boxing until 5.  <br/>
After that, its as much sauce and food you can shovel down your gullet!<br/>
<br/>
Email me for more details if you think you might be able to make it.  <br/>
If you can't, but would like to send in a stamp for planting or table <br/>
finds, email me for that too!<br/>
