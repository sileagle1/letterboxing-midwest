Oklahoma is working on a state patch so I figured I'd offer two <br>

It does seem to make a little bit of difference when they see it <br>

I will not be able to afford to buy a bunch of different styles of <br>

There has been some discussion, but with summer upon us I think that <br>
people are out and about and it might take a bit longer to get a <br>
regional one together.  Also, some of the folks that had been <br>
providing input are also designing one for their state.<br>
