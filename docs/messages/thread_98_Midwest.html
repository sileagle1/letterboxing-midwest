America? So I would say, we are Central to anything around us. The <br/>
drug lords sure know that! ha. Ahhh, now why would I want to mention <br/>
that? Beats me, and speaking of beating, can't you hear the heart <br/>
beats, ka-thump, ka-thump, ka-thump, that's just us little ole' Okie's <br/>
playing our drums, and whooping it up, in time with our big ole' <br/>
hearts. As we are a very friendly state! Come on down or over here, to <br/>
our little mini meet, July 28th, Tulsa, Ok  Chandler Park 10 A.M. See <br/>
AQ event page for more particulars on that subject. Y'all come!!<br/>
In the meantime, <br/>
Keep on boxin'<br/>
