What?  Can't I just lurk in peace?<br>
<br>
;-D<br>
<br>
Hi, I'm Roze; 'trail name' is rozebud.  Just started LBing in March, <br>
after a friend (trail name geckospot) from Delaware (where I'm from <br>
originally) visited and infected me with the madness.  We went for <br>
all the St. Louis area boxes we could ID at that time, and found 7 <br>
of 11 over a 4-day span.<br>
<br>
About a month later, we were in DC for a party, and I got my first <br>
official stamps - the "Kid Gloves" series in Rock Creek Park.  Found <br>
two of the three, and also a micro-box added by another boxer.<br>
<br>
I've now been first finder of a few new boxes in the area (check out <br>
the Queeny Park series by Fairy Princess Fiona - very nice stamps!) <br>
and I'm kinda looking for some other folks in St. Louis interested <br>
in this hobby.  I hope to plant a few new boxes myself this summer, <br>
once the demands of my job slow up a bit after the end of the month.<br>
<br>
Greetings all, and hey - anyone in the Lou' please holla in my <br>
general direction.  Thanks!<br>

There's not that many around, but my evil plan is to plant several <br>
this summer and try to get more folks interested.  So far, the only <br>
two people I've talked to about it who are intrigued were visiting <br>
from Chicago and Massachusetts.  <br>
<br>
My first thought was Tower Grove Park, but in walking around it I see <br>
that it is SO manicured.  Very little "wild" area.  But I did find a <br>
few spots that would work for mini- or microboxes.  I need to research <br>
what containers work best for small boxes, as the Altoids tins and <br>
film canisters and prescription bottles I've found are usually not too <br>
watertight.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<br>
We aren't new members, but I have been lurking for a while and <br>
thought I should just come out in the open.  We started letterboxing <br>
last October here in the Kansas City area and have become pretty <br>
obsessive about it.  There are quite a few boxes in the area, but it <br>
doesn't seem like there are that many real active boxers.  We have <br>
been trying to help, we've planted 7 in KC so far and have plans for <br>
more.  So if you're in the area...why not box?  Anyway, we hope to <br>
get out around the midwest a little more this summer, I'm originally <br>
from Nebraska, so I appreciate how beautiful the midwest can be, but <br>
my wife is from Maine, so for her, if there's no ocean view it's not <br>
scenic.  I'll get her to love the wide open spaces yet.  <br>
<br>
See ya on the trail,<br>

sister-in-law are boxing in the KC area, Wyld Blueberries. We do get<br>
to box there from time to time.  Although probably not this summer.<br>

The ocean is pretty, however, not much beats a beautiful sunset over a<br>
golden field of wheat.  There's quite a bit of sky out here.<br>
