Hi, I'm Roze; 'trail name' is rozebud.  Just started LBing in March, <br/>
after a friend (trail name geckospot) from Delaware (where I'm from <br/>
originally) visited and infected me with the madness.  We went for <br/>
all the St. Louis area boxes we could ID at that time, and found 7 <br/>
of 11 over a 4-day span.<br/>
<br/>
About a month later, we were in DC for a party, and I got my first <br/>
official stamps - the "Kid Gloves" series in Rock Creek Park.  Found <br/>
two of the three, and also a micro-box added by another boxer.<br/>
<br/>
I've now been first finder of a few new boxes in the area (check out <br/>
the Queeny Park series by Fairy Princess Fiona - very nice stamps!) <br/>
and I'm kinda looking for some other folks in St. Louis interested <br/>
in this hobby.  I hope to plant a few new boxes myself this summer, <br/>
once the demands of my job slow up a bit after the end of the month.<br/>
<br/>
Greetings all, and hey - anyone in the Lou' please holla in my <br/>
general direction.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

There's not that many around, but my evil plan is to plant several <br/>
this summer and try to get more folks interested.  So far, the only <br/>

from Chicago and Massachusetts.  <br/>

that it is SO manicured.  Very little "wild" area.  But I did find a <br/>

what containers work best for small boxes, as the Altoids tins and <br/>
film canisters and prescription bottles I've found are usually not too <br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We aren't new members, but I have been lurking for a while and <br/>
thought I should just come out in the open.  We started letterboxing <br/>
last October here in the Kansas City area and have become pretty <br/>
obsessive about it.  There are quite a few boxes in the area, but it <br/>
doesn't seem like there are that many real active boxers.  We have <br/>
been trying to help, we've planted 7 in KC so far and have plans for <br/>
more.  So if you're in the area...why not box?  Anyway, we hope to <br/>
get out around the midwest a little more this summer, I'm originally <br/>
from Nebraska, so I appreciate how beautiful the midwest can be, but <br/>
my wife is from Maine, so for her, if there's no ocean view it's not <br/>
scenic.  I'll get her to love the wide open spaces yet.  <br/>
<br/>
See ya on the trail,<br/>
<br/>
Craw &amp; Joey<br/>

sister-in-law are boxing in the KC area, Wyld Blueberries. We do get<br/>
to box there from time to time.  Although probably not this summer.<br/>

The ocean is pretty, however, not much beats a beautiful sunset over a<br/>
golden field of wheat.  There's quite a bit of sky out here.<br/>
