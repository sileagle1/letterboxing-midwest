I am not a big advocate of crossposting but I feel that there is a good reason
for what I am about to post.  Some of you may have seen the story on Mark
Pepe's blog on Atlas Quest about the plight of some friends of ours from
southeastern Pennsylvania, Dogs with Wings.  In case you haven't, here is
what was posted:</span><span style='font-size: 12pt;font-family: "Comic Sans MS";color: rgb(255, 64, 64);'><br/>
<br/>
Last summer, a new boxing couple joined the southeastern Pennsylvania boxing community.
Their trail name is Dogs with Wings and, Sherry, the carving half of the team,
and I got to know each other through emails after she found several of my boxes
near her home .   We have been corresponding for many months and I
was fortunate enough to actually meet the team in person on one of my ventures
to Hibernia Park in Chester County, PA.  She loves letterboxing and has
proven to be a really good carver.  Well, Sherry and Lee are having some
difficulties right now and I would like to try to help her out.  Lee was
on his way to work about a month ago when he was struck with a great deal of
pain and had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.  From the Paoli
Hospital, where he was diagnosed with an extremely rare and severe case of
pancreatitis, he was airlifted to Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia and placed
on a ventilator.    He sank into a coma and the disease began to
attack some of his other organs.  He was given a 20% chance of survival at
that time.<br/>
<br/>
As if this wasn't enough, there is more to their story.  Lee had just
started a new job within the last year so his short term disability benefits
are very limited.  Sherry had worked up until two months ago, but since
she is studying to be a nurse, she quit her job so that she could focus full
time on finishing her degree.   Sherry has obtained a job at a local
hospital but won't begin working till July.  So this means that they now
have very limited income.  Sherry is spending as much time at Jefferson as
she can as well as finishing up her classes and is totally exhausted,
physically and emotionally.  The hospital and the school are about two
hours drive away from each other which places another burden on her.  She
talks longingly of being able to walk in the woods with her husband again and
of being able to enjoy the simple pleasures of letterboxing.  She is
totally in love with her husband and is very broken by this terrible illness.<br/>
<br/>
When I spoke to her last night, she gave me some good news.  After a month
in a coma, Lee has finally regained consciousness and was removed temporarily
from the ventilator that has been keeping him alive.  The prognosis is
much more encouraging now than it was a month ago. The doctors believe that the
damage to his lungs may heal itself but his pancreas is severely damaged. 
They are not sure what to expect from anything else.  The only thing that
they ARE sure of is that recovery is going to take some time. <br/>
<br/>
So this brings me to my plea for help.  We are asking for the letterboxing
community to give something to this couple in the form of a flat donation or a
pledge to any participant in the Road Rally.  The pledge would be for each
box found during the Rally, either those planted by the Rallymaster or the
"distractions"  planted by various participating teams. 
You can obtain information about the Rally at roadrally.blogspot.com which also
gives the details of last year's Rally.  So far there are seven teams
signed up for the race with more expected shortly.  <br/>
<br/>
</span><span style='font-size: 12pt;font-family: "Comic Sans MS";color: blue;'>The message above is
what was posted but there have been a few more details added since then. 
Crayola Posse, who are two of the best carvers that I have seen, have
volunteered to make an event stamp to be given to anyone who donates. 
Although it hasn't even been designed yet,  I KNOW that you won't be
disappointed in their work.  I would also like to collect a copy of every
contributor's stamp to add to a logbook for Sherry and Lee.  Please let me
know if you can help in any way by contacting me at janila at dejazzd.com.</span>
