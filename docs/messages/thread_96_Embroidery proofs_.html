patches of all kinds.  I don't think there are any rules for them.  <br/>
You could always get patches from different places and not sew them <br/>
on to your backpack (or whatever) until you've been there.  Kind of <br/>
something to look forward to...?<br/>
<br/>
How's the Oklahoma patch coming along?  Last I heard Will was going <br/>
to be lassoing of a derrick with a kite tail of feathers behind a <br/>
surrey with fringe on top.  OK I made up the surrey part but that <br/>
might look mighty fine, too.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well.....its kind a like on the back burner for now it seems. Melody <br/>
has been heading up the charge, so to speak, but she hasn't said any <br/>
more about it lately. She must be pretty busy. I know she is into <br/>
postals cause she sent me one. Only my second and they are fun. SM <br/>
sent me one before that. <br/>
I have been having troubles with my computer, Vista! a far cry from <br/>
Millinium (sp) what I last had. Just figured out how to dl my pics <br/>
from the camera last night. Now to figure out how to downsize them. <br/>
Too big for E-mail and forgot to do it on the camera. Was going to dl <br/>
them to Melody from the mini meet we had. At least three turned out <br/>
great, not so the other two. Eyes closed or whatever. That reminds me <br/>
to go look on AQ for those she took on the event. Hmm...don't know if <br/>
she posted the event now that I think of it. Will see. <br/>
Nix Will Rogers I think. Good idea but maybe a bit much, don't ya <br/>
think? Simple may be better. We are still open to ideas though, don't <br/>
get me wrong. <br/>
What me ramble too much....nah. <br/>
