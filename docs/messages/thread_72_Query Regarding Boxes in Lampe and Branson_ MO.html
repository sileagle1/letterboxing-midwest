Very cool - Thanks!  My friends are in Tarrant county, south west of<br>
Dallas proper.  I was hoping to get there soon, but now it's starting<br>
to look like an August visit.  Dallas in high summer - phew!  When I<br>
visited last August, it was like 110 degrees outside.  At least the<br>
humidity was low...<br>

<p>Hi Lucy,<br/><br/>Very cool - Thanks! My friends are in Tarrant county, south west of<br/>Dallas proper. I was hoping to get there soon, but now it's starting<br/>to look like an August visit. Dallas in high summer - phew! When I<br/>visited last August, it was like 110 degrees outside. At least the<br/>humidity was low...<br/><br/>rozebud<br/>--- Barefoot Lucy &lt;<a href="mailto:barefootlucy%40yahoo.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">barefootlucy@ yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/><br/>&gt; Hey Rozebud,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I haven't been to Dallas to look for boxes in a couple of years, but<br/>&gt; I look at the listing of planters on LBNA and aside from the single<br/>&gt; box guys who I don't know, there isn't a bad planted in the bunch!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Celtic Lions has especially clever placements, but a number of their<br/>&gt; boxes are missing or at risk because they have been unable to<br/>&gt; maintain them lately. They are pretty good about keeping their<br/>&gt; listings up to date
 though. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mater et regisfilia supposedly has excellent boxes, but figuring them<br/>&gt; out is a challenge. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Viewfinder and Puddle Splasher are sisters who have a knack for<br/>&gt; finding cool places and who do good solid boxes with nice stamps. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Sprite and Highlander, Blue Butterfly, Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, JB<br/>&gt; Kokopelli, wandaandpete, Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter are all<br/>&gt; out-of-towners who are well-established box placers in their home<br/>&gt; areas and they all do excellent boxes. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I think if I were going to go boxing up there, I would look toward<br/>&gt; Irving. There are a lot of boxes in that area that I have my eye on,<br/>&gt; if I ever get that way again. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ----- Original Message ----<br/>&gt; From: rozebud.rm &lt;<a href="mailto:rozebud%40rocketmail.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rozebud@rocketmail. com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:LetterboxingMidwest%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LetterboxingMidwest @yahoogroups. com</a><br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, May 14, 2007 3:40:41 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [LetterboxingMidwes t] Re: Query Regarding Boxes in Lampe and<br/>&gt; Branson, MO<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Very nice of you to take this on - good luck! FWIW, I'm no where <br/>&gt; near the two MO boxes, and I don't think there is a boxing community <br/>&gt; to speak of in either location. Columbia is the <br/>&gt; state's "letterboxing hot spot" and outside of that area, it's kinda <br/>&gt; spotty.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Also - I may be visiting the Dallas area this summer and would <br/>&gt; appreciate any info on "must get" boxes around there.

 that has left the game <br/>&gt; and left behind quite a mess for us - all but two of her boxes are <br/>&gt; gone and yet we are unable to modify her clues, so we have folks who <br/>&gt; go looking for her boxes and are frustrated to come up empty-handed, <br/>&gt; and they are that much more frustrated when they learn that it is a <br/>&gt; known problem.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; She has two boxes in MO - Legend of the Dogwood in Lampe and B is <br/>&gt; for Branson in Branson.
