So if people are at least still reading these posts they can come and find my boxes when they are in the areas. Thats good enough for me. :) I'm still in the paperwork stages for a (adopted) box in Spirit Lake, one for Kilen Woods State Park in Minnesota, and one at a nature center an hour from here. I also saw someone placed a box in Sanborn, Ia the other day and plan on finding that one next weekend. I havent found that many yet though. The two I have out there I recently replaced my store bought stamps with hand carved ones, one hasnt been found at all yet and the other had been found once by three people so I took that journal home to save. Haha! I was so excited. I enjoy the carving so I hope to get better at that. I would like to do a series sometime. Those are so cool to me. Havent found any yet though. I didnt do alot of traveling this summer. :( I have been spending alot of time on Atlas Quest, there is so much to learn and know about. Im pretty much still at the beginning stages.

<p><span>Glad to hear you joined the <st1:place w:st="on">Great Lakes</st1:place> group!  I didn’t initially suggest
it since I saw you said you were in <st1:place w:st="on">WESTERN Iowa</st1:place>. 
We have attended two events in <st1:state w:st="on">Iowa</st1:state> (one in
Quad Cities area and one in Decorah) and have met several <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iowa</st1:place></st1:state> boxers at those.  We tend to
include them in our Great Lakes thinking since there isn’t much else
going on in a lot of the area in the official <st1:place w:st="on">Midwest</st1:place>
region.  That’s probably why <st1:state w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:state>
asked to be added to the Great Lakes region instead of <st1:place w:st="on">Midwest</st1:place>
– there was more activity.  MO has been busy, but it seems they tend
to have more of a “state” focus rather than regional (they had a
separate Mid-MO blog which used to be very active, but it seems to have gotten
quieter.  Maybe they all move to AQ, which has happened in a few other
areas of the country).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, just wanted to let you know that
there ARE people who do read this forum, but many of us don’t actually live
in the region!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

carved a couple stamps. One is going in one of my adopted boxes. It makes me

Yeah!! I will get the others replaced soon.<br/>

There wasn't much here in St. Louis when I started, but as they say, "plant, and they will come."  We're starting to get quite a nice little community here, finally, after a few years of my mostly boxing on vacation (lucky for me, my home state of Delaware has a lot of activity, and I visit there fairly frequently...hmmm...it's been a while tho...time to plan a trip?).<br/>
<br/>
So carve, plant, network online, take trips when you can!  you're a long way from St. Louis, but if you ever make it down this way, let me know!<br/>

&gt; I noticed how quiet it is. But sometimes it only takes one person to get things going. Haha! I was invited to join a group that is Letterboxing Great Lakes, its more Minnesota and Eastward, it is a very busy group. I also joined the basement one and cleared up at least one box for them in Hospers. We do alot of hiking and exploring in Minnesota but I do live in Iowa and will do most of my own boxes here. So if people are at least still reading these posts they can come and find my boxes when they are in the areas. Thats good enough for me. :) I'm still in the paperwork stages for a (adopted) box in Spirit Lake, one for Kilen Woods State Park in Minnesota, and one at a nature center an hour from here. I also saw someone placed a box in Sanborn, Ia the other day and plan on finding that one next weekend. I havent found that many yet though. The two I have out there I recently replaced my store bought stamps with hand carved ones, one hasnt been found at all yet and the other had been found once by three people so I took that journal home to save. Haha! I was so excited. I enjoy the carving so I hope to get better at that. I would like to do a series sometime. Those are so cool to me. Havent found any yet though. I didnt do alot of traveling this summer. :( I have been spending alot of time on Atlas Quest, there is so much to learn and know about. Im pretty much still at the beginning stages. I cant wait to not be so much a newbie. Well enough rambling. If there is anyone out there closer to me feel free to email or post, would love to hear from you. Thanks for replying rozebud.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Tess - as you may have guessed, this "Midwest" letterboxing group doesn't see much action...you might want to check on the Iowa board on AtlasQuest.com to find other letterboxers in your area, and/or see if there is an Iowa group here on Yahoo.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello from Spirit Lake, Iowa! Im new to letterboxing and would really like to get some action going here in Norhtwest Iowa. I have only found a few boxes and have placed one of my own and have adopted two local ones that havent been active for years. For right now they have store bought stamps but I am in the process of changing that. I bought some carving supplies and in the last few days carved a couple stamps. One is going in one of my adopted boxes. It makes me laugh. Im not artistic enough to draw my own designs but got one out of some clipart I have. It crackes me up. Its not that great either but im pretty impressed with my first attempts and im happy enough with it to put in a box. Yeah!! I will get the others replaced soon.<br/>
