                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few new boxes went out in Oklahoma yesterday.  My mom and I<br>
discovered a great new place in Norman.  It's the "George M Sutton<br>
Urban Wilderness Area" It's just south of Rock Creek Road on Sooner<br>
Road (12th street in Norman).  We've just explored a bit but it seems<br>
really great.  Woodlands, Lakes, Fields and even a small cemetary.  <br>
<br>
For those of you in OK check it out.  It's also barely maintained. <br>
Which means that boxes shouldn't be discovered by maintenance crews.  <br>
