there?  With the weather changing, will that increase or decrease your <br/>
boxing?  <br/>
<br/>
Over on atlasquest, one of those profile questions is something along <br/>
the lines of "what is the most unusual thing you've discovered while <br/>
letterboxing" to which I have to say, "that I love boxing in cold <br/>
weather!"<br/>
<br/>
I'm preparing boxes and plan on planting soon and forthwith throughout <br/>
Kentucky and SW Indiana.<br/>
<br/>
Kentucky isn't really a big boxing state, but we're doing a statewide <br/>
initiative of planting Superheroes around the state.  If any of you <br/>
would like to throw a stamp in for the mix, I'd be glad to plant for <br/>
you.  I'll soon be putting out the scene from Jean Gray and Cyclops' <br/>
last battle.  It ran as a postal, wherein the comic cover changed to <br/>
have them saying "It's all about the hike!" while the other is <br/>
saying "F Count! F Count."  Just a little tongue in cheek.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to revisit patches soon, as well.  Real life craziness is <br/>
finally slowing down, enabling (I hope) lots of December boxing.  For a <br/>
change, Teepsman and I are staying at home for Christmas.  After 20 <br/>
years, that's something new.  The tree is up, but needs ornaments <br/>
added.  That's a start.  Last year, it was the 18th when we finally <br/>
thought about decorations and added a wreath to the door, but by that <br/>
time, we were about to head to DisneyWorld for Christmas, so there was <br/>
no tree.  Both of us thought we were living an after-school special.<br/>
<br/>
Happy late Thanksgiving to you all - I hope by now that you guys are <br/>
finally getting hungry and not feeling so full from eating too much <br/>
turkey and trimmings.  <br/>
