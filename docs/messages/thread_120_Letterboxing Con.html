To those whom it may CONcern:<br/>
we have a CONfession to make.<br/>
It may require your CONcentration<br/>
to clear up your preCONceptions,<br/>
so give me your CONtinuous attention<br/>
while I present these CONcepts.<br/>
I can barely CONtain my excitement,<br/>
but I will try to CONtrol it!<br/>
This is an official CONfirmation<br/>
that there will be a CONgregation<br/>
of folks who love waterproof CONtainers.<br/>
We have been CONcealing<br/>
the CONfiguration, but we <br/>
needed time for reCONnaissance<br/>
and CONduction of meetings.<br/>
Finally, the CONditions are right,<br/>
and we have a CONtract.<br/>
We hope to CONvince you<br/>
that the CONtents<br/>
of this CONversation<br/>
will CONsole your anxieties.<br/>
This event is not a CONtradiction,<br/>
and it has been CONstructed<br/>
to allow us to make CONnections<br/>
and be a CONsumer<br/>
within the CONtext of letterboxing.<br/>
You might even meet some iCONs of our hobby!<br/>
Announcing! A Letterboxing CONvention!<br/>
<br/>
Please see: http://www.letterboxingCON.info<br/>
<br/>
to meet your CONspirators,<br/>
CONsider the ideas we have CONjured,<br/>
and CONfirm your attendance.<br/>
<br/>

This CONcludes our letterboxer service announcement,<br/>
by the CON Committee<br/>
