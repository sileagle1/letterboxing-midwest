                    <div class="plaintext-content">Where are we camping?  That seems to be aloaded question.  It appears that I <br>
have offended some by not disclosing the location of the gatheirng yet.  I'm <br>
afraid some have taken it as an attempt to keep it a secret known by only a <br>
few.  Let me clarify.<br>
<br>
On my origional post on the blog I said the first 15 who RSVP get an <br>
invitation (hand-made, kind of fancy thing).  Part of the invitation is a <br>
clue which those who recieve them have to solve and decode to reveal the <br>
location.  It's a fun little thing that adds to the event I think.  Once the <br>
invitations have been mailed out and everyone recieved theirs, I will post <br>
it on the blog for the world to see.  Not being eletist, just trying to <br>
sneak in an Ah-Ha moent for those who were kind enough to RSVP quickly.<br>
<br>
ANY and ALL are welcome.  But those who didn't get in on the first RSVP list <br>
will have to wait a few days more to learn the location.<br>
<br>
This is supposed to be all fun and games.  If you MUST know the location, <br>
let me know.<br>
<br>
The invites go out at the end of this week and I'll post all the details on <br>
the blog on Monday.<br>
