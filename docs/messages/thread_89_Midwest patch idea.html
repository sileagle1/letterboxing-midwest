Iowa and corn you mentioned, <br>

Say we went with a round patch.  The outer area rimmed in black or <br>
some dark framing color.<br>

Did one of those 'amber waves of grain' background colors.  Or a <br>
large close up of a wheat and corn in the center part.  Superimpose <br>
Letterboxing Midwest in the center.<br>

top, consisting of 4 states, the one at the bottom (for visual weight <br>

The Pacific Northwest patch that Funhog designed is a banana slug <br>
holding an umbrella, and the patch is shaped like a raindrop -- so it <br>
represents unique and common things about the region.<br>
<br>
I think this is a great approach for the midwest -- just think of <br>
things that represent the region, and I bet a patch idea will come <br>
into focus pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
The silo is great, I think. What animals do you think of in the <br>
region? What about the topography? I think of the plains and the <br>
prairies, and then prairie dogs, and bison.<br>
<br>
What other icons of midwest America can you think of?<br>

<br>
It seems as though Oklahoma wants to do a state patch (which is <br>
cool, too, because it means more patches to earn/buy/whatever).<br>
<br>
My area is not Just a state though, it's the stateline...sigh...<br>
<br>
Still thinking.<br>
<br>
I'll get some more ideas out in the file maybe next week.<br>
<br>
Please, anyone can upload a file if they want, the more ideas the <br>
more choices PLUS it may spark a brainstorm for someone else!<br>
