                    <div class="plaintext-content">I could be filling out a hundred of these things. Anyone have any information on handling these things. How important are they? Does everyone fill them out for every box? Every where I want to put a box its State land and what about city parks?? Is permission required for just about anywhere a box is hidden? I printed a few out and they are slightly annoying...filling out the box location, directions to the box, gps for the box, before I even put the box out there. It's alot of work. Worth it if I have to but wondering if everyone fills these out for every box or what. If I want to put a box somewhere a couple hours from here and have to go find my hiding spot then come back, send in the form, then wait, if approved go back to place it might limit my hides. And we dont want that! :)Any help, info., tips, would be great.<br/>

Havent done much since last post. It's either raining or we end up doing something else.<br/>
<br/>
I do have one other question....how do you figure your clues, meaning when you go out to hide your box, do you take a notebook and write basic clues and go home and add the details or ??? That is my biggest hold up in placing my latest box is making sure I have enough time to figure out the paces/landmarks/directions/etc.<br/>
I have read that people will take a bunch of ready boxes with them when they head out to box or travel, it seems like alot to me, and how to figure the clues. And obviously if someone is placing a bunch of boxes in one day they probly arent getting permission from every single park or state land. <br/>
<br/>
Also what are the thoughts on boxing in Winter here is Iowa. I wasnt sure if I should leave my boxes out there or pick them up. I dont know if the cold is good for my stamps. I know I HATE going out after there is more than a few inches of snow on the ground for the rest of Winter so I wont be outside letterboxing. I know right now I dont have a bunch of finders but some day I hope to. :)<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get involved with postals and LTC's for the Winter months. Im currently trying to create my first LTC but cant think of my theme. So thats still in the works.<br/>

<p><span>When we plant a box, we DO take a piece of
paper of notebook along to jot down pertinent information.  We usually note the
time we start and then anything that we might use as a landmark and general
comments on the terrain.  We won’t necessarily use all the info, but by
having lots of things it lets us pick &amp; choose what we’ll use.  We
then note what time we finish.  We finalize clues at home, perhaps making them
into a coded format, a story, or whatever.  However we almost always include a
note about the terrain and the approximate distance or time to complete.  This
helps people make a more informed decision as to whether it is a hike they
would like to do, and if they have enough time to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">For state permits, we try to be aware of the local regulations about <br/>
planting boxes.  We don't plant them in state parks or national parks <br/>
that have posted regulations.  This also covers certain counties within <br/>
the states.  If we are going out of town to plant a box, we try to ask <br/>
the locals if they know of any posted regulations.  If nothing is <br/>
posted, then we take the fall back position of DADT like everyone else.  <br/>
For planting in unfamiliar parks, we usually just find a park that, on <br/>
paper, looks like it might contain an appropriate surrounding for a <br/>
box.  We shy away from parks that don't have lots of forested areas or <br/>
that seem to have busy locations.  With that in mind, we'll have a box, <br/>
in hand, ready to go.  We then go off in a direction that seems to offer <br/>
a hike of an appropriate length.   As we go along, we usually write the <br/>
clue in our head and we jot down notes.  When we go home, we write the <br/>
clues that day (or at the latest the next) while the clues are still <br/>
fresh in our minds.  Depending on the length of the hike and available <br/>
landmarks, this process can be quick or can take a decent while.<br/>
<br/>
As for boxes, they are usually very sturdy.  However, you need to be <br/>
sure that they are sturdy when you place them.  Make sure they don't <br/>
leak when squeezed, make sure they can likely withstand a moderate <br/>
amount of force, and be sure they aren't easily opened.  If a box (We <br/>
like the Lock and Locks) can pass those tests, it will likely not allow <br/>
moisture inside, tolerate a branch falling on it, and survive curious <br/>
critters.<br/>
<br/>
And for winter, its a GREAT time to plant boxes.  If your box is well <br/>
hidden in the winter, it will be VERY WELL hidden in the spring after <br/>
all the plants bloom.  Be sure to avoid areas (just like when you plant <br/>
in spring) that will likely be covered with lakes of snow melt.   Winter <br/>
means you don't have to worry as much about ichy/pointy plants, <br/>
stinging/biting animals, or being spotted by muggles who tend to only <br/>
come out to enjoy the summer's sun.  Just be sure to use landmarks for <br/>
clues that will be present in the spring/summer, and don't go searching <br/>
for boxes that reference things on the ground that might be covered in <br/>
snow.  On the other hand, it is a good time time plan for spring and get <br/>
some carving done...either for traditional boxes, LTCs, or postals <br/>
(depending on what you like).<br/>

&gt; when they head out to box or travel, it seems like alot to me, and how <br/>
&gt; to figure the clues. And obviously if someone is placing a bunch of <br/>
&gt; boxes in one day they probly arent getting permission from every <br/>
&gt; single park or state land.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also what are the thoughts on boxing in Winter here is Iowa. I wasnt <br/>
&gt; sure if I should leave my boxes out there or pick them up. I dont know <br/>
&gt; if the cold is good for my stamps. I know I HATE going out after there <br/>
&gt; is more than a few inches of snow on the ground for the rest of Winter <br/>
&gt; so I wont be outside letterboxing. I know right now I dont have a <br/>
&gt; bunch of finders but some day I hope to. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm trying to get involved with postals and LTC's for the Winter <br/>
&gt; months. Im currently trying to create my first LTC but cant think of <br/>
&gt; my theme. So thats still in the works.<br/>

<div>For state permits, we try to be aware of the local regulations about <br/>planting boxes. We don't plant them in state parks or national parks <br/>that have posted regulations. This also covers certain counties within <br/>the states. If we are going out of town to plant a box, we try to ask <br/>the locals if they know of any posted regulations. If nothing is <br/>posted, then we take the fall back position of DADT like everyone else. <br/>For planting in unfamiliar parks, we usually just find a park that, on <br/>paper, looks like it might contain an appropriate surrounding for a <br/>box. We shy away from parks that don't have lots of forested areas or <br/>that seem to have busy locations. With that in mind, we'll have a box, <br/>in hand, ready to go. We then go off in a direction that seems to offer <br/>a hike of an appropriate length. As we go along, we usually write the <br/>clue in our head and we jot down notes. When we go home, we write the
 <br/>clues that day (or at the latest the next) while the clues are still <br/>fresh in our minds. Depending on the length of the hike and available <br/>landmarks, this process can be quick or can take a decent while.<br/><br/>As for boxes, they are usually very sturdy. However, you need to be <br/>sure that they are sturdy when you place them. Make sure they don't <br/>leak when squeezed, make sure they can likely withstand a moderate <br/>amount of force, and be sure they aren't easily opened. If a box (We <br/>like the Lock and Locks) can pass those tests, it will likely not allow <br/>moisture inside, tolerate a branch falling on it, and survive curious <br/>critters.<br/><br/>And for winter, its a GREAT time to plant boxes. If your box is well <br/>hidden in the winter, it will be VERY WELL hidden in the spring after <br/>all the plants bloom. Be sure to avoid areas (just like when you plant <br/>in spring) that will likely be covered with lakes of snow melt.
 Winter <br/>means you don't have to worry as much about ichy/pointy plants, <br/>stinging/biting animals, or being spotted by muggles who tend to only <br/>come out to enjoy the summer's sun. Just be sure to use landmarks for <br/>clues that will be present in the spring/summer, and don't go searching <br/>for boxes that reference things on the ground that might be covered in <br/>snow.

  &gt; Someone else also suggested this. Going to give it a try. If it would <br/>
  &gt; only stop raining on the days I plan to hide.<br/>
  &gt; Thanks for replying.<br/>
  &gt; Havent done much since last post. It's either raining or we end up <br/>
  &gt; doing something else.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I do have one other question.... how do you figure your clues, meaning <br/>
  &gt; when you go out to hide your box, do you take a notebook and write <br/>
  &gt; basic clues and go home and add the details or ??? That is my biggest <br/>
  &gt; hold up in placing my latest box is making sure I have enough time to <br/>
  &gt; figure out the paces/landmarks/ directions/ etc.<br/>
  &gt; I have read that people will take a bunch of ready boxes with them <br/>
  &gt; when they head out to box or travel, it seems like alot to me, and how <br/>
  &gt; to figure the clues. And obviously if someone is placing a bunch of <br/>
  &gt; boxes in one day they probly arent getting permission from every <br/>
  &gt; single park or state land.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Also what are the thoughts on boxing in Winter here is <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iowa</st1:place></st1:state>. I wasnt <br/>
  &gt; sure if I should leave my boxes out there or pick them up. I dont know <br/>
  &gt; if the cold is good for my stamps. I know I HATE going out after there <br/>
  &gt; is more than a few inches of snow on the ground for the rest of Winter <br/>
  &gt; so I wont be outside letterboxing. I know right now I dont have a <br/>
  &gt; bunch of finders but some day I hope to. :)<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I'm trying to get involved with postals and LTC's for the Winter <br/>
  &gt; months. Im currently trying to create my first LTC but cant think of <br/>

<p><span>Not sure what DADT stand for. And thanks for the info. I will turn in all permits for the boxes I hide in state parks in  Iowa , and def. for the ones in Minnesota . The rest probly wont.  Since its so new around here I will take some chances and hope for the best. </span></p></div>
<div>
<p><span>I have been using different things for boxes and so far all have worked very well. Winter will be the true test I think. </span></p></div>

<p><span>Thank you all for the information. Just confiming that I am doing things right. Or if there were easier ways. </span></p></div>

<p><span>For state permits, we try to be aware of the local regulations about <br/>planting boxes. We don't plant them in state parks or national parks <br/>that have posted regulations. This also covers certain counties within <br/>the states. If we are going out of town to plant a box, we try to ask <br/>the locals if they know of any posted regulations. If nothing is <br/>posted, then we take the fall back position of DADT like everyone else. <br/>For planting in unfamiliar parks, we usually just find a park that, on <br/>paper, looks like it might contain an appropriate surrounding for a <br/>box. We shy away from parks that don't have lots of forested areas or <br/>that seem to have busy locations. With that in mind, we'll have a box, <br/>in hand, ready to go. We then go off in a direction that seems to offer <br/>a hike of an appropriate length. As we go along, we usually write the
 <br/>clue in our head and we jot down notes. When we go home, we write the <br/>clues that day (or at the latest the next) while the clues are still <br/>fresh in our minds. Depending on the length of the hike and available <br/>landmarks, this process can be quick or can take a decent while.<br/><br/>As for boxes, they are usually very sturdy. However, you need to be <br/>sure that they are sturdy when you place them. Make sure they don't <br/>leak when squeezed, make sure they can likely withstand a moderate <br/>amount of force, and be sure they aren't easily opened. If a box (We <br/>like the Lock and Locks) can pass those tests, it will likely not allow <br/>moisture inside, tolerate a branch falling on it, and survive curious <br/>critters.<br/><br/>And for winter, its a GREAT time to plant boxes. If your box is well <br/>hidden in the winter, it will be VERY WELL hidden in the spring after <br/>all the plants bloom. Be sure to avoid areas (just like when you
 plant <br/>in spring) that will likely be covered with lakes of snow melt. Winter <br/>means you don't have to worry as much about ichy/pointy plants, <br/>stinging/biting animals, or being spotted by muggles who tend to only <br/>come out to enjoy the summer's sun. Just be sure to use landmarks for <br/>clues that will be present in the spring/summer, and don't go searching <br/>for boxes that reference things on the ground that might be covered in <br/>snow. On the other hand, it is a good time time plan for spring and get <br/>some carving done...either for traditional boxes, LTCs, or postals <br/>(depending on what you like).<br/><br/>Atom of Atomic Beans<br/><br/>&gt; Someone else also suggested this. Going to give it a try. If it would <br/>&gt; only stop raining on the days I plan to hide.<br/>&gt; Thanks for replying.<br/>&gt; Havent done much since last post. It's either raining or we end up <br/>&gt; doing something else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do have one other
 question.... how do you figure your clues, meaning <br/>&gt; when you go out to hide your box, do you take a notebook and write <br/>&gt; basic clues and go home and add the details or ??? That is my biggest <br/>&gt; hold up in placing my latest box is making sure I have enough time to <br/>&gt; figure out the paces/landmarks/ directions/ etc.<br/>&gt; I have read that people will take a bunch of ready boxes with them <br/>&gt; when they head out to box or travel, it seems like alot to me, and how <br/>&gt; to figure the clues. And obviously if someone is placing a bunch of <br/>&gt; boxes in one day they probly arent getting permission from every <br/>&gt; single park or state land.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also what are the thoughts on boxing in Winter here is Iowa . I wasnt <br/>&gt; sure if I should leave my boxes out there or pick them up. I dont know <br/>&gt; if the cold is good for my stamps. I know I HATE going out after there <br/>&gt; is more than a few inches
 of snow on the ground for the rest of Winter <br/>&gt; so I wont be outside letterboxing. I know right now I dont have a <br/>&gt; bunch of finders but some day I hope to. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I'm trying to get involved with postals and LTC's for the Winter <br/>&gt; months. Im currently trying to create my first LTC but cant think of <br/>&gt; my theme.
