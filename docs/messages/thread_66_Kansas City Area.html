It will be a trial run for when there is interest.<br>

********NEWS FLASH*********<br>
Y'all have proven you're worth in the woods and on the nature <br>
trails, how about seeing what it's like to box in the jungle?  OK, <br>
so KC isn't that big of a city (jungle), but there's stuff here.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of an Urban Walk.  The main event site would be (most <br>
likely) at Loose Park with the partial city tour taking boxers to <br>
various places in the immediate area.  It's hard to plant in the <br>
open as y'all may know, but there are some great boxing <br>
possibilities; UMKC, Volker Park (Frank A Theis), The Nelson, <br>
Southmoreland Park, JC Nichols Fountain area, Vietnam Vet's <br>
Memorial,  The Plaza, Brush Creek and of course, Loose Park.<br>
<br>
Details to follow, looking at a Saturday in mid-September.<br>

Saturday, Sept 15, 2007.<br>

I went to the Mid-MO Pirate Event, May 5, and it was spectacular and <br>
in a more rural setting.  I'm hoping the contrast of an urban event <br>
has it's own appeal.<br>
<br>
If nothing else it will be a trial run for a more traditional rural <br>
event in the area and hopefully we'll get to know some folks in the <br>
area and hopefully see some of our Mid-Mo and Eastern-Mo friends <br>
again.<br>
<br>
I'll post more information when there is more news. <br>

I'm hoping the contrast of an urban <br/>event<br/>&gt; &gt;has it's own appeal.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;If nothing else it will be a trial run for a more traditional <br/>rural<br/>&gt; &gt;event in the area and hopefully we'll get to know some folks in <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;area and hopefully see some of our Mid-Mo and Eastern-Mo friends<br/>&gt; &gt;again.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I'll post more information when there is more news.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Thanks,<br/>&gt; &gt;Perdu<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;--- In <a href="mailto:LetterboxingMidwest%40yahoogroups.com">LetterboxingMidwest<wbr>@yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "The Haydens"<br/>&gt; &gt;&lt;hayden@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Perdu,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So far... except for the 22nd, we will be there! We haven't<br/>&gt; &gt;LB'd in KC yet so will be fun. And fun to meet everyone else...<br/>&gt; &gt;It also may be a great way to get a friends involved.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for setting it up!!!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ~us4inKs<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; From: perdu_watcher<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; To: <a href="mailto:LetterboxingMidwest%40yahoogroups.com">LetterboxingMidwest<wbr>@yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, May 13, 2007 9:58 AM<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [LetterboxingMidwes<wbr>t] Re: Kansas City Area<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the feelers that I've put out, it does
 not seem as though<br/>&gt; &gt;there<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is enough interest in hosting an event in the KC area.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Still, I may do it anyway and if no one shows, then no one<br/>&gt; &gt;shows.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It will be a trial run for when there is interest.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ********NEWS FLASH*******<wbr>**<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Y'all have proven you're worth in the woods and on the nature<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; trails, how about seeing what it's like to box in the jungle?<br/>&gt; &gt;OK,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so KC isn't that big of a city (jungle), but there's stuff <br/>here.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm thinking of an Urban Walk. The main event site would be<br/>&gt; &gt;(most<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; likely) at Loose Park with the partial city tour taking <br/>boxers<br/>&gt; &gt;to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; various places in the immediate area. It's hard to plant in <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; open as y'all may know, but there are some
 great boxing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; possibilities; UMKC, Volker Park (Frank A Theis), The Nelson,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Southmoreland Park, JC Nichols Fountain area, Vietnam Vet's<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Memorial, The Plaza, Brush Creek and of course, Loose Park.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Details to follow, looking at a Saturday in mid-September.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; *******END of NEWS FLASH*******<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I will be X-Posting this on AQ on the Events board, for those<br/>&gt; &gt;who do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not subscribe to this list.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; All feedback is welcome and wanted.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ~Perdu<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ____________<wbr>_________<wbr>_________<wbr>_________<wbr>_________<wbr>_________<wbr>_<br/>&gt; Make every IM count.
