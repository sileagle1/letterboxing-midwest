If you are here through Thursday of this week, my visiting friend<br>

Ok, we might not get all eight planted this week.  But we're gonna try.<br>

StLouis looks terrible in person, at least my parents' neighborhood. <br>
Instead of finding and hiding boxes, we spent much of our day<br>

and right like matchsticks.<br>
<br>
My parents, thankfully, have power, unlike much of the city.<br>
<br>
So, I didn't get my boxes hidden.  I'll do it next time, unless<br>
someone going that way would like me to send them the boxes to plant,<br>
I'll happily do so.<br>
<br>
Hope the others from the area are doing well,<br>
