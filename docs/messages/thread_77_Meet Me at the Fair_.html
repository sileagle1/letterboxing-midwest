&gt; Sunday, September 23 (is Sunday an option for you?) for the STL <br/>

her <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So now you know too much of our plans. Fingers X'd that 9/22 or <br/>
9/23 <br/>
&gt; works out!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to email off-group to discuss themes, stamps / logs / <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; you want me to help with, venue - anything at all! Forest Park <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; be a fine place to gather, unless you want something more "rustic". <br/>
&gt; Maybe Babler? There are some nice big shelters there so we'd be <br/>
snug <br/>
&gt; as bugs (or bees? :-) in the event of rain...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm all excited now! Thank you SO MUCH for organizing this - my <br/>

I figure I'll leave <br/>it in place as long as the festival runs and then pull it. Then I'll <br/>update it and put it back out each year that I live here during the <br/>festival... An updated bonus for anyone who comes to see the show <br/>year after year...I assume you'll be first finder, but maybe someone <br/>will surprise you :) The B Hunters<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; "rozebud.rm" &lt;rozebud@...<wbr/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Yay!

She'd plan to fly in on Friday so we'd have plenty of <br/>time <br/>&gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; make ready. She also said she'd bring a couple/few things to <br/>plant -<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; yay! I'm
 taking the week off from work, and we'll be boxing and <br/>&gt; &gt; camping and camping and boxing all week, then I'll settle in at <br/>&gt; home <br/>&gt; &gt; while she convenes, confers, converses, and otherwise hob-nobs <br/>with <br/>&gt; her <br/>&gt; &gt; fellow wizards - er, I mean, petsitters.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; So now you know too much of our plans. Fingers X'd that 9/22 or <br/>&gt; 9/23 <br/>&gt; &gt; works out!<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Feel free to email off-group to discuss themes, stamps / logs / <br/>&gt; boxes <br/>&gt; &gt; you want me to help with, venue - anything at all! Forest Park <br/>&gt; would <br/>&gt; &gt; be a fine place to gather, unless you want something <br/>more "rustic". <br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe Babler? There are some nice big shelters there so we'd be <br/>&gt; snug <br/>&gt; &gt; as bugs (or bees? :-) in the event of rain...<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I'm all excited now! Thank you SO MUCH for organizing this - my <br/>&gt; &gt; natural
 tendency towards slackardness kept me from taking it this <br/>&gt; far, <br/>&gt; &gt; so I commend you!
