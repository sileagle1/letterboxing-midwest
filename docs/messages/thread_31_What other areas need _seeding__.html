There are some areas that are covered as well as Connecticut but<br>
others are pretty bare.  Columbia, MO is pretty amazing.  Arkansas<br>
seems pretty slim.<br>

What do you think?<br>
<br>
I know here in Oklahoma we've got a pretty good number of boxes, but<br>
most were hidden by 1 or 2 groups.  We'd all like to have more to find<br>
of course.<br>

Fox-Fyr and I just returned from a weekend trip into south east MO and <br>
southern Ill and picked up a good number of LBs.  I had done the same trip <br>
last year and only found about half.  This year I picked up a few new and <br>
Fox-Fyr came back with 11 new.<br>

I might be interested in making a trip to OK and possibly plant a series <br>
there if one of the locals would look in on it for me from time to time.<br>
