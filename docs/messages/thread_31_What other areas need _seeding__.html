I know here in Oklahoma we've got a pretty good number of boxes, but<br/>
most were hidden by 1 or 2 groups.  We'd all like to have more to find<br/>

Fox-Fyr and I just returned from a weekend trip into south east MO and <br/>

last year and only found about half.  This year I picked up a few new and <br/>
Fox-Fyr came back with 11 new.<br/>
