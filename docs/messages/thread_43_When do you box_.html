country during the summer.  It just gets so hot we all slow down but<br/>
other parts of the country they're still going strong.<br/>
However, in a few months we'll begin again and keep boxing virtually<br/>
all winter even, while other places have to stop.<br/>
<br/>
When is your favorite time to box?  <br/>
<br/>
Kind of related, when you place boxes in early spring do you take into<br/>
account how the foliage will grow and change?  How about when you<br/>
place in the fall, do you think about what will die and therefore<br/>
expose your boxes through the winter?<br/>

trail. It's a series of 12 placed in December and this is the third <br/>
time for us to try and finish it all up. The first couple of times we <br/>
got some was in the spring. All the landmarks easily showed up, no <br/>
poison ivy, no chiggars, beautiful weather. In August, though, it's a <br/>
different landscape. We had a hard time telling where the last box <br/>
that we had found was located; one box we just said forget it as the <br/>
amount of poison ivy between the box and the bike path was an itch <br/>
gulf.<br/>
<br/>
It's all just one more reason to like boxing -- whoever knew we had so <br/>
much vegetation in Kansas?<br/>

great to meet your and your family.  I'm glad you enjoyed the cave <br/>
experience so much.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly I'm busy the holiday weekend.  however, Rock Bridge SP is a <br/>
fabulous place to visit, even without entering the Devils Ice Box.  In <br/>
particular is Connor's Cave, which is open all year and is easy, and <br/>
interesting at the same time.  If you'd like more info I'd be glad to help <br/>
you set up a day of exploring.  The park also has a great Orienteering <br/>
course, with maps available at the park office.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, but have you ever heard of a hobby called Letterboxing?  <br/>
It's kind of like a treasure hunt where you print clues from the internet <br/>
then go about looking for hidden boxes which contain a logbook and a hand <br/>
carved stamp.  I usually don't publicize this semi-secret hobby of mine, but <br/>
your family seems like a swell bunch.  I do a lot of Letterboxing with my 5 <br/>
year old son and he loves it.  Might be something your family would enjoy.  <br/>
Typicaly the clues are straight forward and only require a compass.  While <br/>
it is similar to geo-caching, I believe it is far superior.  No need for <br/>
hi-tech gear.  LB is much more 'under the radar' than geo-caching and we <br/>
kind of like it that way.  If you do go, PLEAS re-hide any box you find <br/>
completely.  Some folks leave them exposed and the box goes missing.  If <br/>
you're interested take a look at www.letterboxing.org and you can also see <br/>
some of the things our local LB (Letterboxing) group has done at, well, the <br/>
address escapes me, but run a search for Mid Missouri Letterboxers.  You <br/>
should quickly find our blog.  Browse through the archives and you'll see <br/>
some of our gatherings.  Wow!  What a ramble.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefuly we can catch up sometime and crawl thorugh a cave or two.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in touch!<br/>
