LOL!  I was there Friday night; we were very short on volunteer help, <br>
so I was there handing out programs from 5 - 8PM.  I saw the lady you <br>
spoke to Wednesday - she said that someone had been looking for me <br>
earlier in the week, "...an attractive young woman with an ADORABLE <br>
child in tow" is what she said.  So there you go - compliments for <br>
you and your little one!  :-D<br>
<br>
>   We have to do a mini meet since Baker St Searchers are coming to <br>
town in about 2 weeks. The B HUnters<br>
 <br>
Two weeks should be good for me; I will be going out of town for 8 <br>
days starting late on Thursday, 6/28, so I hope it's before then.  <br>
Let me know - thanks!<br>
