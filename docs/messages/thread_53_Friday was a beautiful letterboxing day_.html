Friday! Our kids had off for parent teacher conferences, so we hit the <br>
road and went out to explore Manhattan, Kansas. We were three for <br>
three and had a nice time searching for prairie boxes. Besides the <br>
boxes, we went to the insect zoo at K-State. (Not really a destination <br>
experience, but fun.) The kids held giant hissing cockroaches and <br>
petted the tarantula. We did plant a box on the way back, so if you're <br>
on an I-70 road trip you'll have to check out Camp Daisy (clues not <br>
posted yet, but soon.)<br>

you?   We are in Lawrence.   My girls and I started 
letterboxing this summer thanks to the Family Fun magazine article.  We 
haven't ventured out of Lawrence yet.   I do have a folder with clues 
for road trips.  I have some of your clues in that folder, so look forward 
to finding your boxes.  : )</font></div>
