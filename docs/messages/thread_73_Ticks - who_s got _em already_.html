After planting two in SW Indiana on Sunday, we had three, thankfully <br>
just hanging out on clothing.  The third one I discovered in my hair on <br>
Monday, after being on the trail Sunday.  I wear my hair up on the <br>
trails to keep from giving them a foothold onto the old bod.  I kind of <br>
think that one was in the car from the day before though, seeing how it <br>
was entangled and not being a sucker tick.<br>
<br>
Blech.  Nasty things they.<br>

I agree - they are nasty, nasty, nasty.  We hates them.<br>
