<br>
First...welcome to all the new people who have recently signed up to be <br>
part of our reserved (read that as quiet) MidWest group!<br>
<br>
After reading over at the Great Lakes and Newboxers groups about <br>
people's first finds, I have a question for y'all.  What was your first <br>
box that you planted?  Is it still there?  Would you change the <br>
location?  What made you plant your first box in that location?  Did <br>
you "mama hen" it for a while?  You know, checking in on it frequently?<br>
<br>
My very first box, a Do Tell! thing made remained at its location for <br>
roughly 8 or so months before going missing.  Whoever even took the <br>
rock that was sitting over it.  In all fairness, we had a rash of boxes <br>
go missing for a while here in Louisville over a year or two.  When one <br>
would go mia, so would several others, so I'm guessing it was someone <br>
hitting them all at one time.  Remarkably, I've got one about 6 feet <br>
from that spot that has been there for over a year and a half.  I chose <br>
that park because it had a nice walking path, wasn't used very much, <br>
and was in nice shape...plus very close to the house.<br>
<br>
I know that over the past four or so years, my methods of planting and <br>
what I choose to plant have changed tremendously. Learn and do, and <br>
constantly adapt to beliefs and such.  :-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first box I planted was "CP1" (which was just over a year ago).   I <br>
chose the location because: (A) I found a good out of the way place to <br>
hide it (B) it is located near-by a bunch of 'odd' foot-traffic so any <br>
potential finders would fit right in (C) I had a stamp that I had carved <br>
more-or-less on a lark that would fit the location [and I was proud of <br>
it] (D) I could post it without an exact address but one that could be <br>
easily deciphered after a quick Google Search and (E) it would bring <br>
people to an interesting part of town that is more commonly talked about <br>
than visited.  The location also allowed for what I though were <br>
semi-tricky clues....it was my first box, I didn't want to make it super <br>
easy!<br>
<br>
I had planted it near my work so I could keep a close watch on it.  When <br>
the first few people would come and find it, I'd quickly go back to <br>
check on it and see the stamps and any comments that were written.  Now, <br>
I hardly go look for it...just enough to keep myself convinced that it <br>
is still there.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My first box was Mardi Gras-07.  It was (still is) way too big, but <br>
I wanted a feathered mask to cover it...well, I thought it would be <br>
cool at the time.  It still looks pretty cool, but way, way too <br>
big.  I included a First Finder Certificate that I designed for a <br>
Mardi Gras and a Mardi Gras...umm...guardian.  <br>
<br>
I don't think I'd change the location.<br>
<br>
The finders who've e-mailed me have so far enjoyed it.  The only <br>
thing this one has that no other of my plants have (other than the <br>
ridiculously large box) is a store bought log.  I've thought of <br>
changing it out and maybe I will someday.<br>
