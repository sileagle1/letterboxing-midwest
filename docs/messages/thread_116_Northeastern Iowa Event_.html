there is a conflict of dates!)<br/>
<br/>
Less than a month remains until the Northeastern Iowa Letterboxing<br/>
Event, held in Decorah, IA on May 3, 2008!!! We are so excited and<br/>
look forward to a great event with lots of neat stamps to be planted<br/>
in an area that has yet to see letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
All are invited and encouraged to attend! Please see the event link<br/>
for more details:<br/>

<br/>
And, if the raffle prizes aren't enough to tempt you... I have it on<br/>
good authority that there will be a special appearance by a bagpiper! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
A wonderful day in the beautiful Oneota River valley meeting fabulous<br/>
people and finding terrific artwork in a fun and casual atmosphere.<br/>
What could be better?!<br/>
