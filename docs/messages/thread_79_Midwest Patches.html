I have patches for quite a few regions that we have boxed in, but <br>
haven't heard of one for the Midwest yet.  If you have a contest, I'd <br>
encourage you to do it similar to what the Pacific Northwest region <br>
did.  Members of the group posted graphics into a specific folder on <br>
the Yahoo Group and after all the images were in, someone setup a <br>
poll on the message board (using the handy "Poll" feature).  That way <br>
people can see ideas as they come in and can comment on them.  This <br>
allowed some of the PNW designs to be refined (in terms of colors or <br>
fonts) before a final vote was taken.<br>

the Great Lakes that incorporates several states, but if people <br>
would rather have their own state that would be fine, too.<br>
<br>
I just posted a similar question on AQ to see if anyone there has <br>
knowledge/preference of any existing or contributing to the design <br>
process.<br>
<br>
Would you be interested in a patch?  Would you prefer a Kansas Patch <br>
or a patch with multiple states in the midwest?<br>
<br>
Would you be interested in contributing a design for vote?<br>
<br>
I'm not only asking Us4InKS, but everyone who might read this <br>
board.  You certainly would not have to live in the midwest to <br>
submit a design or to have a patch.<br>
<br>
Please share your thoughts.<br>

Yeah, it's still there, but you may need to join the group to see it.  <br>
Here's a link to try:<br>
<br>
http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW/photos/browse/ae9d<br>
<br>
The nice thing about using the Yahoo groups are that all members can <br>
contribute individually and you aren't dependent on someone else to <br>
make the time to post the stuff.  Anyone can add a file, link, photo <br>
or poll whenever they want.  On the Great Lakes group, we can also <br>
easily create a database and any member can add a record.  Not sure <br>
why, but it doesn't look like you have the database feature enabled on <br>
this group.  We've used the database feature to list what campsites <br>
people will be at for an event, the subject matter for stamps being <br>
carved for an event (to avoid duplication), etc.  It is a lot easier <br>
to find this info if it is in a single place, rather than spread <br>
across multiple email messages.  I know the Midwest group is small <br>
right now, but I just wanted to let you know about some of the nice <br>
features on the Yahoo groups message boards.<br>

Hope you consider coming to the Kansas City Event September 15 (it's <br>
on the group's Calendar), though I hope to be at the St. Louis one, <br>
also.<br>

  multiple states in the midwest?<br/><br/>Would you be interested in contributing

For discussion:  If you were to take that LBNA off that rounds off the <br>
ear of the corn, add in South Dakota and North Dakota, drop a green <br>
leaf behind that and then add a "ear bud" offshoot for Kentucky, that <br>
would include all of the 9 states in this group, wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
MidWest Region Yahoo groups encompasses Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, <br>
Kentucky,  Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South <br>

Geez, does KY even grow corn?  Our money makers include tobacco and <br>
pot.  ;-)  There's always the bourbon too.<br>

Tra La, La, again, Corn as high as an Elephants Eye, if you listen to <br>
our song-me-I prefer Florida's sweet corn, ha. <br>
<br>
Seriously though, I think of water. NE Oklahoma is green and lush <br>
especially right now with all the rain we've had recently, but we <br>
have lots of lakes, rivers, and streams to keep us happy. Living in <br>
Tulsa we could drive any direction and reach some kind of water <br>
recreation fairly quickly. <br>
Drive downtown this Friday and see what 50 years of water can do to a <br>
57 Plymouth Belevedeer (sp). Yes, they are digging it up and it <br>
doesn't look too promising by what the news said tonight. Hopefully <br>
the time capsule will be unharmed inside it. The bag the car was <br>
bagged in sprung a leak, but they said the engine and all mechanical <br>
parts were coated with some sort of material that could possibly keep <br>
it in decent shape. We shall see on Friday. Bummer for those folks <br>
expecting to get a great car from the lottery or whatever conducted <br>
back in '57. Or their off spring if deceased. <br>
I've rattled on long enough. <br>
Corn is good in my opinion, for whatever that's worth. <br>

Tra La, La, again, Corn as high as an Elephants Eye, if you listen to <br>
our song-me-I prefer Florida's sweet corn, ha. <br>
<br>
Seriously though, I think of water. NE Oklahoma is green and lush <br>
especially right now with all the rain we've had recently, but we <br>
have lots of lakes, rivers, and streams to keep us happy. Living in <br>
Tulsa we could drive any direction and reach some kind of water <br>
recreation fairly quickly. <br>
Drive downtown this Friday and see what 50 years of water can do to a <br>
57 Plymouth Belevedeer (sp). Yes, they are digging it up and it <br>
doesn't look too promising by what the news said tonight. Hopefully <br>
the time capsule will be unharmed inside it. The bag the car was <br>
bagged in sprung a leak, but they said the engine and all mechanical <br>
parts were coated with some sort of material that could possibly keep <br>
it in decent shape. We shall see on Friday. Bummer for those folks <br>
expecting to get a great car from the lottery or whatever conducted <br>
back in '57. Or their off spring if deceased. <br>
I've rattled on long enough. <br>
Corn is good in my opinion, for whatever that's worth. <br>
