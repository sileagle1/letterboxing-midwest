photo suggestion.  Hopefully, I'll get to Oklahoma by winter to do <br/>
some boxing, then if they come out with a patch I'd like to order one.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd pass on the info in case anyone else is interested.  <br/>
The more they have ready to buy the easier that first order will be.<br/>

affect things.  Probably less people = less ideas, but should also <br/>
make it easier to make a decision.  I thought there were a fair <br/>
number of MO boxers - aren't any/many of them on this board?<br/>
<br/>
In the Great Lakes region we already had a "logo" associated with our <br/>
Yahoo message board.  (It had been designed by SpringChick).  I just <br/>
asked her if we could use it for a patch design,  After she agreed I <br/>
posted a message to the group to see how much interest there would be <br/>
in patches with this design and got a good response.  I sold 200 <br/>
patches in less than a year and then reordered another 100 recently <br/>
with our new design (which includes Minnesota).<br/>
<br/>
I think the Southeast group did something similar to us, just used a <br/>
logo that was already established for the group.  I think Mid-<br/>
Atlantic and Pacific Northwest posted ideas and then used the poll <br/>
feature to tally votes. I don't remember how long the process took, <br/>
but probably a month or two.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of REGIONAL patches, since I sure don't have room on <br/>
my pack to put a patch for every state!  We always purchase a patch <br/>
(if available) when we box in a specific region.<br/>
<br/>
So far I like the "corn &amp; wheat" or the "barn" designs the best.  I'd <br/>
probably prefer the "Letterboxing Midwest" text at top and bottom, <br/>
rather than listing all the states.  This concept (representative <br/>
image w/o states) would be similar to the PNW design (Slug) and <br/>
MidAtlantic (sun/star/compass?).<br/>
<br/>
Since we've already boxed in Iowa, we'll definitely be interested in <br/>
purchasing a patch.<br/>

Oh, that it explains it!  I'm surprised they would prefer a blog format <br/>
over the Message Boards.  Lots of easy to use features (files,links, <br/>
photos, etc) in the Yahoo Groups that are accessible to all, not just <br/>
the blog owner. Although a blog can be more "colorful"...<br/>
