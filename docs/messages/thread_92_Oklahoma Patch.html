photo suggestion.  Hopefully, I'll get to Oklahoma by winter to do <br>
some boxing, then if they come out with a patch I'd like to order one.<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd pass on the info in case anyone else is interested.  <br>
The more they have ready to buy the easier that first order will be.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I think this group is smaller than most others, so that can <br>
affect things.  Probably less people = less ideas, but should also <br>
make it easier to make a decision.  I thought there were a fair <br>
number of MO boxers - aren't any/many of them on this board?<br>
<br>
In the Great Lakes region we already had a "logo" associated with our <br>
Yahoo message board.  (It had been designed by SpringChick).  I just <br>
asked her if we could use it for a patch design,  After she agreed I <br>
posted a message to the group to see how much interest there would be <br>
in patches with this design and got a good response.  I sold 200 <br>
patches in less than a year and then reordered another 100 recently <br>
with our new design (which includes Minnesota).<br>
<br>
I think the Southeast group did something similar to us, just used a <br>
logo that was already established for the group.  I think Mid-<br>
Atlantic and Pacific Northwest posted ideas and then used the poll <br>
feature to tally votes. I don't remember how long the process took, <br>
but probably a month or two.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of REGIONAL patches, since I sure don't have room on <br>
my pack to put a patch for every state!  We always purchase a patch <br>
(if available) when we box in a specific region.<br>
<br>
So far I like the "corn & wheat" or the "barn" designs the best.  I'd <br>
probably prefer the "Letterboxing Midwest" text at top and bottom, <br>
rather than listing all the states.  This concept (representative <br>
image w/o states) would be similar to the PNW design (Slug) and <br>
MidAtlantic (sun/star/compass?).<br>
<br>
Since we've already boxed in Iowa, we'll definitely be interested in <br>
purchasing a patch.<br>

Oh, that it explains it!  I'm surprised they would prefer a blog format <br>
over the Message Boards.  Lots of easy to use features (files,links, <br>
photos, etc) in the Yahoo Groups that are accessible to all, not just <br>
the blog owner. Although a blog can be more "colorful"...<br>
