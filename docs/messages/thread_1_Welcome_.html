<br>
It is great to have this new group representing that whole strip of <br>
states down the middle of the country there.  I am from the Great <br>
Lakes region and am here mostly just to keep an ear to the ground as <br>
to what is going on in the other regions, not so much as an active <br>
participant.<br>
<br>
Great photo on the home page!  Good luck with the group!<br>
