The inimitable Ruby Tuesday of Dallas coined a phrase<br>
for spouses who aren't really letterboxers, but who go<br>
along and don't complain and are even quite helpful<br>
sometimes - if they are good-spirited about<br>
letterboxing in spite of not being "into it".  She<br>
called hers her LSS - Long-Suffering Spouse.  It's a<br>
term of endearment!<br>
