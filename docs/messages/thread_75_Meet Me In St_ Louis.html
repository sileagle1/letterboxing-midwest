                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, let's talk dates for a St. Louis gather...fall is great for me <br/>
(spring is INSAAAAAAAANE at work).  My 'boxing fiend - er, friend, <br/>
from Delaware, geckospot, will be in town for a convention Sept. 27 - <br/>
29, and will wrap a week around this visit.  We'd like to know if it <br/>
should be the week before or the week after, so if we could look at <br/>
gather dates, that would be helpful for her planning.  <br/>
<br/>
There's a (slim) chance that if we set a date early enough, one or <br/>
two other folks from the Mid-Atlantic group might come out.  I had a <br/>
BLAST last fall with these folks at "It's Only a Game" and would love <br/>
to return the horse brutality - er, hospitality!<br/>
<br/>
B Hunters, if you need October instead, that's cool - but geckospot <br/>
would like to attend if the timing is right.<br/>

Oh, no - I did not want to be in charge!  I had the idea, and gave up <br/>
on it, because my job is just getting too big right now; until they <br/>
listen to me and hire at least one more F/T person, I really don't <br/>

Please, you wanted to do something, so do as you will.  I will gladly <br/>
help out in any way I can!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Any date is pretty good with us. Is MidMo going to have a fall <br/>

I don't know if MidMO has a fall date set yet, but I'm sure LndCrzr <br/>
will let us know.  If we do something here earlier, like end of <br/>
September, that probably would not interfere with them, because I <br/>
think they have their fall event later in October.  I didn't realize <br/>
that the "Pirate bonanza" was that close!  I guess I just assumed it <br/>
was closer to Columbia than St. Louis...more fool me, I say!<br/>

Oh, yay!  You stopped by the build!  I was there briefly this morning <br/>
before coming to the office; it is looking good.  Most of the folks <br/>
doing the build won't know me from Adam (or Eve); they are seasonal <br/>
folks brought in just for a few weeks and really don't interact with <br/>
us office-staff-types.<br/>

&gt;A special box will be in place on opening night honoring this fine <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Y'know, it doesn't have to be an all extravaganza type event.  We <br/>
recently did a small gathering in Lexington, KY and surrounding areas <br/>
for the sole purpose of putting some boxes down in the area, with an <br/>
understanding that the sole local letterboxer will check in from time <br/>
to time on them.  <br/>
<br/>
Basically, people were asked to come prepared, planting a box or <br/>
three, write up clues, meet up from 1-3, allowing for someone to head <br/>
to Kinkos to make sets of clues, then disbursed for boxing the new <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun, but short.  <br/>
<br/>
We could do something easy, then move it to a restaurant for further <br/>
visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas, ideas.. :-)<br/>

MWL - the horseradish in Collinsville is calling too! <br/>

Oh yes, what are the local park placing rules in St. Louis?<br/>
