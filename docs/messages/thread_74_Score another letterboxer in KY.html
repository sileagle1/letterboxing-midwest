                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi MoWizLiz.  Thanks for having us!  My husband is in the Army, and we <br>
have been stationed here at Ft. Knox for almost a year.  I started <br>
letterboxing on Mother's day with my husband Kelly, my daughter Izzy, <br>
and our friends Team Hand.  We are Team Foot.  We found your boxes at <br>
Bernheim.  It was awesome.  I had never heard of the forest before, but <br>
we all fell in love with it.  We plan on taking the kids there once a <br>
week this summer.  We are planning a visit to Otter Creek this coming <br>
Sunday.  My family has been there before, and we are looking forward to <br>
indroducing team hand to the park!  <br>
<br>
