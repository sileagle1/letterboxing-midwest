                        Hi all,

                        We had planned to find these boxes next week when we were there.  It
looks like the storms didn't really affect West County and these

Anyone know?  I know they've got more to worry...

                        Hi dewberrylb and all,

Yep - things were/are a mess here.  The storm was maybe a twister (get
into the root cellar, Dorothy!) and there's plenty of property damage.

                        We mentioned St. Louis, what other areas surprise you by the lack of
boxes?

There are some areas that are covered as well as Connecticut but
others are pretty bare.  Columbia, MO is pretty amazing. ...

                        Anyone spend time boxing over the holiday.  

We found boxes in Oklahoma and Missouri.  Tried to find one in
Arkansas.  We even helped place one in Missouri.

Hot weekend, but fun.
